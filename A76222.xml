         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He tumultuary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions and distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions about the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> which have been raised by many he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical and schismatical fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands, have moved me to publish these popular Sermons, in order to the satisfaction and setlement of such minds, as have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snared to a misunderstanding of this Article of the Creed. It grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me to hear so many Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that were all Baptized into the Catholick Church, and there
<pb facs="tcp:170535:3"/> received the badge of Christianity and Catholicism, to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully enquiring, which is the true Catholick Church, and many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viders confining it to their Sects: and lastly, the <hi>Seekers,</hi> (instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Papists) with seeming seriousness, questioning whether there be any Church and Ministry at all? But never any Sect did cause my admiration so much as the Papists! That ever so many Princes and Learned men, should so odiously vilifie the Catholick Church, and that under pretence of magnifying it, and appealing to it. They are not contented in their Doctrine of <hi>Transubstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,</hi> to <hi>deny sense and reason (Et contra Rationem nemo sobrius)</hi> and in many of their writings to speak diminutively and dishonourably of the <hi>holy Scriptures</hi> (too like to Infidels: <hi>Et contra Scripturas ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo Christianus;)</hi> but they also cut
<pb facs="tcp:170535:3"/> off themselves (as Sectaries) from the Universal Church, as farre as an uncharitable odious <hi>condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the farre greatest part of the Church</hi> can do it, and call the Church (even that <hi>greatest part)</hi> by the name of Hereticks and Schismaticks; <hi>(Et contra Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siam nemo pacificus.)</hi> And as confidently and contentiously do they labour to cut off the main body of believers, and to appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate the Catholick Church to themselves, and to make their corrupted Sect to be the whole, as if the Catholick Church had been limited to the <hi>Roman,</hi> in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, or the Creed; or as if they had the Consent of Christ himself for the divorcing of his Spouse. And the men that call <hi>Charity</hi> the <hi>form,</hi> and <hi>soul,</hi> and <hi>life</hi> of the new creature, do seem to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible of the brand of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happiness; and that there is no
<pb facs="tcp:170535:4"/> greater uncharitableness to be found on this side hell, than the malicious reproaching, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and unchurching of the farre greatest part of the Church of Christ; except that of Infidels, who condemn the whole. When you hear them glorying of their Charity, come hither and rub your eyes, and see what Popish Charity is.</p>
            <p>For the right understanding of this following Discourse, I shall only desire the <hi>Reader</hi> to observe, 1. That it is not a particular Church, but the Universal, that I am here enquiring after. 2. That I do not intend hereby to equalize the several parts of the Catholick Church, as to purity of Doctrine, Discipline or Worship. 3. That yet I would have all Christians joyn themselves in actual particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Communion, with the purest Churches, if they can obtain it,
<pb facs="tcp:170535:4"/> without greater hurt to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves or others, then the benefits will countervail. And that I do not intend, that we must hold lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Communion with every Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, which must be owned as a part of the Catholick Church. It is possible they may require a participation in some sinne, of all those that they will admit to their Communion: And in such cases, (when they exclude us) we can hold but such a general distant Communion, which they cannot prohibit. 4. That when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Schisme and unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableness of the Papists, or any others, I yet condemn not, but commend our exercise of Charity to them, and shall own all that is of Christ in them, as far as I can discern it.</p>
            <p>Lastly, Be advertised, That whereas in another Book, that comes out with this (called <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:170535:5"/>
               <hi>Ʋnity)</hi> I have again taken up many of the particulars where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Godly are United, I think it need not offend the Reader, as an unnecessary repetition, that being but the application of the truth which is here asserted. There I labour to convince the ungodly, That Concord can be obtained by no other means, and on no other terms, than those which I have <hi>here</hi> shewed the Godly are all agreed in.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reader,</hi> if indeed thou love the Church of Christ, joyn with me in thy heartiest daily prayers, and in thy faithfull diligent endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, for the destroying of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and the repairing of decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Charity, and the restoring of Catholick Principles and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to all the members of the Church.</p>

You would think this were rather the descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of a Bedlam, than of a Christian! to set all on fire, and furiously to rail at all that would quench it, and at the same time to rail as much at incendiaries, and cry out for Concord, and against Division, and call other men all that's naught, for doing that which they do themselves,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170535:8"/> and will not be perswaded from? But to the injurious dishonour of Christianity it self, it is thus with millions of professed Christians! Thus is the Church used: The sinne and shame is made so pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, that no Charity can much excuse it, and no shift can cover it from the reproachfull observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those that are without. Alas our flames do rise so high, that <hi>Turks,</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> stand looking on them, and ask, What is the matter that these Christians thus irreconcilably worry one another! Do we need any proof, when we feel the smart! when we see the blood! when we hear the noise of revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers at home, and see the scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full laughters of those abroad! when almost all Christendom is up in armes! when the Churches are of so many by-names, and broken into so many odious fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:170535:9"/> and so many volumes flie abroad, containing the reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and condemnations of each other! And (which is enough to break an honest heart to think or speak of) that all this hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued so long a time! and they be not so wise as the passionate, or the drunken, that in time will come to themselves again; and that it hath continued not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the greatest means that are used for the cure: Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation prevaileth not: pacifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory endeavours have done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most nothing: Nay sinne gets advantage in point of Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Dividing is counted a work of Zeal, and Ministers themselves are the principal lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of it; yea and Ministers of eminent parts and piety; and piety it self is pretended for this, which is the poison of piety: and pacification is become a suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170535:9"/> or derided work; and the Peacemakers are presently suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of some heresie; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps call'd Dividers for seeking Reconciliation. It made my heart ake with grief, the other day, to read over the Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the endeavours of one man (M. <hi>John Dury)</hi> to heal the Protestant Churches them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and to think that so much ado should be necessary to make even the leaders of the Christian flocks to be willing, to cease so odious a sinne, and come out of so long and dolefull a misery; yea; and that all should do so little good, and get from men but a few good words, while they sit still and suffer the flames to consume the deplorate rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: Yea such havock hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision made, and cut the Church into so many pieces, that it is become one of the commonest
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170535:10"/> Questions among us, which of these pieces it is that is the Church: One saith, <hi>We are the Catholick Church;</hi> and another saith, <hi>No, but it is we!</hi> and a third contendeth, that it is <hi>one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they:</hi> And thus men seem to be at a losse, and when they believe the <hi>holy Catholick Church,</hi> they know not what it is, which they say, they believe. Though I dare not presume to hope of much success, in any attempts against this distraction, after the frustration of the farre greater endeavours of multitudes that have attempted it with farre greater advantage, yet I have resolved by the help of Christ, to bear witness against the sinne of the Dividers, and leave my testimony on record to posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that if it may not excite some others to the work, yet at east it may let them know, that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170535:10"/> all were not void of Desires for Peace in this contentious age. To which purpose I intend, 1. To speak of the Unity and Concord of the Catholick Church. 2. Of the Unity and Concord of Christians in their particular Churches, and in their individual state. And the first Discourse I shall ground upon this Text, which from the simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of a Natural Body, doth assert, 1. The multiplicity of the members: And, 2. The Unity of the Body or Church of Christ, notwithstanding the multiplicity of the members. The members are here said to be <hi>many</hi> for number, and it's intimated (which after is more fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed) that they are divers for Office, and Use, and Gifts. The Church here spoken of is the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal Church, as it is both in its visible and mystical state: It
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170535:11"/> is not onely a particular Church that is here meant: Nor is it the Catholick Church only as mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, or only as visible, but as it containeth Professours and Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, the body and soul, which make up the man, having both <hi>Ordinances,</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> in their Possession. That it is the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church is apparent: 1. In that it is denominated in the Text from Christ himself, <hi>[So also is Christ.]</hi> And the <hi>Ʋniversal</hi> Church is more fitly denominated from Christ as the Head, then a <hi>particular</hi> Church. It's not easie to find any Text of Scripture that calleth Christ the <hi>Head</hi> of a <hi>particular</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation (as we use not to call the King, the Head of this, or that Corporation, but of the Commonwealth) though he <hi>may</hi> be so called as a <hi>Head</hi> hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the several members:
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170535:11"/> but he is oft call'd the <hi>Head of the Chtholick Church,</hi> Ephes. 1. 22. &amp; 4. 15. Colos. 1. 18. &amp; 2. 19. Ephes. 5. 23. <hi>The Head of such a Body,</hi> is a commoner phrase, than the <hi>Head of the hand or foot.</hi> 2. Because it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely called <hi>[the Body of Christ]</hi> which title is not given to any particular Church, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but part of the Body, <hi>vers.</hi> 27. 3. It is such a Church that's here spoken of, to which was given <hi>[Apostles, Prophets, Teachers, Miracles, Healings, Helps, Governments, Tongues, &amp;c.] vers.</hi> 28. 8, 9, 10. But all particular Churches had not all these; and it's doubtfull whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Corinth</hi> had all that's here mentioned. 4. It is that Church which <hi>all are Baptized into, Jews and Gentiles, bond and free:</hi> But that is onely into the Universal Church. The Spirit doth not
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:170535:12"/> baptize, or enter men first, or directly into a particular Church; no nor the Baptisme of water neither alwayes, nor primarily. The scope of the Chapter, and of the like discourse of the same Apostle <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. do shew, that it's the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> that is here spoken of.</p>
            <p>The sense of the Text then lieth in this Doctrine.</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>The Ʋniversal Church being the Body of Christ is but</hi> One, <hi>and all true Christians are the Members of which it doth consist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here are two Propositions: First, <hi>That the Catholick Church is but One.</hi> Secondly, <hi>That all Christians are Members of it,</hi> even all that by the One Spirit are Baptized into it. These are <hi>both</hi> so plain in the Text, that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170535:12"/> were not men perverse or very blind, it were superfluous to say any more to prove them. And for the former Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>[That the Catholick Church is but One]</hi> we are all agreed in it. And therefore I will not needlesly trouble you with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering such Objections as trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble not the Church, which are fetcht from the difference of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church, and the <hi>Gentile</hi> Church, (or strictly Catholick) or between the called (the true members) and the Elect uncal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; or between the Church mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant and triumphant.</p>
            <p>And as for the second Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, <hi>[That the Catholick Church consisteth of all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as its Members]</hi> it is plain in this Text, and many more. It is all that (heartily) say <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus is the Lord,</hi> vers. 3. and all that <hi>are baptized by one Spirit</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:170535:13"/>
               <hi>into the Body,</hi> vers. 13. and all that <hi>Paul</hi> wrote to, and such as they: And yet some of them were guilty of division, or schism it self, and many errours and crimes, which <hi>Paul</hi> at large re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth them for. The <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians</hi> were members of this Church <hi>(Gal.</hi> 3. 26, 27, 28, 29.) for all their legal conceits and errours, and for all that they dealt with <hi>Paul</hi> as <hi>an enemy</hi> for <hi>telling them the truth.</hi> This Church consisteth of all that have the <hi>[One Spirit, one Faith, one Baptism, one God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all,</hi> &amp;c.] and of all that <hi>[have so learned Christ, as to put off the old man, and to be renewed in the Spirit of their minds, and put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousnesse and true holinesse, Ephes:</hi> 4. 4, 5, 6, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24.] This Church consisteth
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170535:13"/> of all that <hi>Christ is a Saviour of,</hi> and that are <hi>Subject</hi> unto Christ, and for <hi>whom he gave himself, that he might sanctifie and cleanse them by the washing of water by the Word,]</hi> Ephes. 5. 23, 24, 25, 26. It containeth all such as the <hi>Romans</hi> then were to whom <hi>Paul</hi> wrote, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 4, 5. how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever differing among themselves to the censuring of each other. It containeth in it all such <hi>as shall be saved,</hi> Act. 2. 47. These things are beyond all just di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute.</p>
            <p>When I say, that <hi>[All Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians are members of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church.]</hi> I must further tell you, that men are called <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> either because they are truly and heartily the Disciples of Christ; or else because they <hi>seem</hi> so to be by their Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The first are such Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans as are justified and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:170535:14"/> and these constitute the mystical Body of Christ, or the Church as invisible: <hi>Professours</hi> of this <hi>inward true Christianity,</hi> do constitute the Church as vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to men. Professors of <hi>some pieces only</hi> of Christianity, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out or denying any <hi>Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> part of it, are not Professors of Christianity truly, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are no members of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Church: And therefore we justly exclude the <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas it is a great Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, <hi>Whether Hereticks are Members of the Catholick Church?</hi> The answer is easie: Contend not about a word. If by a <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick,</hi> you mean a man that <hi>denieth,</hi> or <hi>leaves out</hi> any <hi>essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> part of Christianity, he is <hi>no</hi> member of the Church: But if you extend the word so farre as to apply it to those that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:170535:14"/> not, or leave not out any essential part of Christianity, then such Hereticks <hi>are</hi> mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church. It is but the perversness of mens spirits exasperated by disputation, that makes the Papists so much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose our distinction of the <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals</hi> of Religion, from the rest: when at other times they confesse the thing in other words themselves. By the <hi>Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals</hi> we mean the <hi>Essentials</hi> of the Christian Faith, or Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And do they think indeed that Christianity hath not its <hi>essential</hi> parts? Sure they dare not deny it, till they say, it hath no <hi>Essence,</hi> and so is <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> which an Infidel will not say? Or do they think, that every revealed truth, which we are bound to believe, is essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to our Christianity? Sure they dare not say so, till they
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:170535:15"/> either think that no Christian is bound to believe any more than he doth believe, or that he is a Christian that wants an essential part of Christianity, or that Christianity is as many several things, as there be persons that have several degrees of faith or knowledge in all the world. For shame therefore lay by this sens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse cavil: and quarrel not with the light by partial zeal, lest you prove your cause thereby to be darknesse. But if you perceive a difficulty (as who doth not, though it be not so great as some would make it) in discerning the <hi>Essential</hi> parts from the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrals,</hi> do not therefore deny the unquestionable distinction, but joyn with us for a fuller dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the difference.</p>
            <p>In a few words <hi>[Every man that doth heartily Believe in God the Father, Sonne and holy Ghost,</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:170535:15"/>
               <hi>by a faith that worketh by love, is a true Christian.</hi> Or <hi>[Every one that taketh God for his onely God, that is, his Creator, Lord, Ruler, and felicity, or end, and Jesus Christ for his only Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that is, God and man; that hath fulfilled all righteousnesse, and given up himself to death on the crosse, in sacrifice for our sinnes, and hath purchased and promised us pardon, and grace, and everlasting life; and hath risen from the dead, ascended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven, where he is Lord of the Church, and Intercessour with the Father, whose laws we must obey, and who will come again at last to raise and judge the world, the righteous to everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life, and the rest to everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing punishment: and that taketh the holy Ghost for his sanctifier, and believeth the Scriptures gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by his inspiration, and seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:170535:16"/>

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:170535:16"/> profession, is a member of the Catholick Church as visible. These things are plain, and in better dayes were thought suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</p>
            <p>He that hath all that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained but in the ancient Creed, the Lords Prayer and ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, with Baptisme and the Lords Supper, in his head, and heart, and life, is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a member of the Catholick Church. In a word, it is no harder to know, <hi>who is a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of this Church,</hi> then it is to know, <hi>who is a Christian.</hi> Tell me but what <hi>Christinity</hi> is, and I will soon tell you how a Church member may be known.</p>
            <div type="part">

Some in their conversations maintain their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, and walk blamelesly, and without offence, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 6. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 15. And some are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

And being overcome with creature-respects, many good men walk <hi>not uprightly,</hi> in some things, nor <hi>according to the truth of the Gospel,</hi> and others that are good also are <hi>led away</hi> in a party by the example of their miscarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and the high estimation of their parts and persons, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 11, 12, 13, 14. Some are firm and stedfast in the truth: and some hold it with shaking, and are oft looking behind them, and sometimes are declining and going backward, and have need to be call'd upon to return to their <hi>first love,</hi> and to <hi>strengthen the things that remain:</hi> Yea some grow to forsake many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent truths, and neglect ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny weighty duties, yea to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:170535:21"/> these truths and duties, and speak against them, as thinking them to be none. Hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that some live in a holy Peace and joy, as <hi>health</hi> is most<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accompanied with <hi>ease;</hi> when others live in continual lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and complaints; and some in too much stupidity and carelesness; and some with dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous mixtures of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded, misguided, deluding peace.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Hence also it follows, that the members are not all of the same <hi>usefulnesse</hi> and <hi>serviceable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> to the Church, and cause of Christ. Some are as pillars to support the rest, <hi>Galat.</hi> 2. 9. 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 14. And some are a trouble to others, and can scarce go any further than they are guided and supported by others. Some lay out themselves in the helping of others: and some are
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:170535:21"/> as the sick that cannot help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but trouble the house with their complaints and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities, which call for great and continual attendance. Some are fit to be Teachers of others, and to be <hi>Pastors</hi> of the flock, and guide the Lords people in the way of life, and <hi>give the children their meat in season, rightly dividing the Word of truth.</hi> And some <hi>are still learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and never come</hi> to much <hi>knowledge of the truth,</hi> and do no great service to God in their generations: Yea too many <hi>wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> their teachers and brethren by their frowardnesse and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfulnesse: and too many do abundance of <hi>wrong</hi> to the Church and Gospel, and the world by their offensive miscarriages: Yea too many prone as thorns in our sides, and by some errour in their understandings, cherished
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:170535:22"/> and used by the too great rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of pride, self-conceitedness, passion and carnality, are grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous afflictours of the Church of Christ, and causes of dissention; One saying, <hi>I am of Paul, and another I am of Apollo, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I am of Christ,</hi> as if <hi>Christ were divided,</hi> or else appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them, and <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo</hi> had been their Saviours, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Some live so as that the Church hath much benefit by their lives, and much losse by their death: And some are such troublers of it, by their weaknesse and corrupt distempers, that their death is some ease to the places where they lived. And yet all these may be truly godly, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving members of the Catholick Church.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Moreover, the members are not all the same in regard
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:170535:22"/> of <hi>Office.</hi> Some are appointed to be <hi>Pastors, Teachers, Elders, Overseers,</hi> to be <hi>Stewards of Gods mysteries,</hi> and to <hi>feed the flock, taking heed</hi> to them all, as being <hi>over them in the Lord,</hi> as their <hi>Rulers</hi> in spiritual things, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 11. <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 23. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 17, 28. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 7, 17. And some are the <hi>flock,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to <hi>learn</hi> of them, to have them in <hi>honour,</hi> and <hi>highly esteem them for their work sake, and to obey them,</hi> 1 Thess. 5. 12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. In this Chapter saith <hi>Paul, [If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling? Are all Apostles? Are all Prophets? are all Teachers?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 17, 29.] As there are <hi>diversity of gifts,</hi> so also of <hi>Offices:</hi> For God hath designed
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170535:23"/> men to use the gifts they have in such order and manner as may edifie the Church. All the body is not the bonds, or nerves and ligaments, by which the parts are joyned together, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 16. All are not <hi>Pastors and Teachers, given for perfecting of the Saints, the work of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, and edifying of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Christ,</hi> Ephes. 4. 11, 12, 13.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Consequently, the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers have not all the same <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment:</hi> Magistrates must <hi>Rule by force;</hi> and Ministers must <hi>guide</hi> or <hi>rule by the light</hi> and force of the word of God: All must not administer Sacraments: all must not be the <hi>Overseers</hi> of the flock. Masters and parents have <hi>their own</hi> work: and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and children have <hi>theirs.</hi> Nay difference of understanding may cause a great deal of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170535:23"/> among Ministers and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the manner of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, when yet all worship him acceptably and in sincerity. Some may be too much ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious in meats and drinks, and observation of dayes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. &amp; 15. in gestures, vestures, and other circumstances, sinfully lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much more in these than God would have them: and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may be as rigorous against them: and others more tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate between both. Some may pray and praise God in formes composed by themselves or others, or read them on a Book: and some may abhor all this as unlawfull; and some may be so wise, as to know that it is a matter that God hath left in it self indifferent, and is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined according to the suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness of times and persons. And thus many model circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170535:24"/> differences there may be in the true worshipping of God by the members of this One Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Church.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And from what is said al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, it follows, That all the members of the Church are not all equally to be honoured and loved. Even among the Elders there are some that <hi>are worthy of double honour,</hi> and some of more than they, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. Some are of high and excellent gifts and graces; and as more of God doth shine forth in them, so a greater love and honour is due to them. Some are so emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently self-denying, and of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick spirits, and wholly carried to the service of God, and the good of the Church, that few others are <hi>like minded, naturally caring for the peoples state, but all do too much seek their own,</hi> and too little <hi>the things that are</hi>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:170535:24"/>
                  <hi>Jesus Christs,</hi> Philip. 2. 20, 21. The body hath some parts that are <hi>lesse honourable,</hi> and <hi>lesse come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 22, 23, 24. though these also have their honour and comeliness. Those that most honour God, shall be most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 30. <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 26. And they that will be the <hi>servants of all, shall be the greatest,</hi> Luk. 22. 26. Mat. 23. 11.</p>
               <p n="10">10. To conclude, from all this imparity it will follow, that the members <hi>will not have an equal degree of Glory,</hi> as not having an equal preparation and capacity. All are not in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams bosome,</hi> as <hi>Lazarus</hi> was. To sit on <hi>Christs right hand and left in his Kingdom,</hi> will not be the lot of all, but of those to <hi>whom the Father will give it, Matth.</hi> 20. 23. All are not to <hi>sit on thrones, in full equality with the Apostles,</hi> Luk. 20. 30.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:170535:25"/> There <hi>are of the first</hi> for time of coming in, <hi>that shall be last</hi> in dignity, and <hi>of the last that shall be first,</hi> Matth. 19. 30. &amp; 20. 16. All shall not be <hi>Rulers of five Cities,</hi> but only they that have doubled <hi>five talents,</hi> Matth. 25. And thus I have shewed you the disparity of the members, wherein they differ.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <p>Secondly, I am now to shew you the <hi>Ʋnity</hi> of them, and of the Body which they constitute. The Members of the Catholick Church are <hi>united</hi> in all these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing respects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They have all but <hi>One God,</hi> the Fountain of their being and felicity, and are all related to him as children to <hi>One Father,</hi> reconciled to them, and adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in Jesus Christ, <hi>John</hi> 1. 12. <hi>Galat.</hi> 3. 26. <hi>Ye are all</hi>

               <p n="2">2. The Members of the Church have all <hi>One Head,</hi> the Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Saviour, Mediator Jesus Christ, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 5. As the Commonwealth is denominated from the Unity of the <hi>Sovereign</hi> power that heads it; so the Church is hence principally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated <hi>One</hi> from Christ, who is the Head, the Sovereign, and the Center of it. And therefore it is called frequently his Body, and he the Head of it, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 15. &amp; 1. 22. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 18. &amp; 2. 19. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 23. <hi>Colos.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 4, 5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 17. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 16.

All therefore are members of the Catholick Church, that are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Christ. He is <hi>the chief corner stone, that's laid in Zion, elect and precious, and he that believeth on him shall not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded; to whom coming as to a living stone, we also as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house,]</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 4, 5, 6. As this <hi>One died for all,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 14. <hi>because all were dead, so by the righteousnesse of this One, the free gift cometh on all to Justification of life; and by the Obedience of this One shall many be made righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,</hi> Rom. 5. 18, 19. <hi>And by One Jesus Christ we shall reign</hi>

                  <hi>in life,</hi> Rom. 5. 17, In him the Church of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> are <hi>made One,</hi> Eph. 2. 14, 15. To this <hi>One Husband</hi> we are all <hi>espoused,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2. So that we [are <hi>all One in Christ Jesus]</hi> Galat. 3. 28. And <hi>to us there is but One God the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and One Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we in him,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 6.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The whole Catholick Church (strictly taken, as comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely the living Members) have only <hi>One holy Ghost</hi> dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in them, illuminating, san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying and guiding them, and are animated, as it were, by this One Spirit. <hi>By this One Spirit we are all baptized into One Body, and have been all made to drink into One Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 13. And <hi>whoever hath not this Spirit of Christ, the same is</hi>

                  <hi>none of his,</hi> Rom. 8. 9. <hi>By this One Spirit we have all accesse to the Father,</hi> Ephes. 2. 18. And through this <hi>Spirit</hi> we are <hi>One habitation of God,</hi> Ephes. 2. 22. And therefore <hi>he that is joyned to the Lord</hi> is called <hi>One Spirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17. And as it is said of Christ, so may it be of the Spirit in a sort, <hi>He that sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, and they that are sanctified are all of One,</hi> Heb. 2. 11. This is the scope of the Chapter that my Text is in.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Church is <hi>One</hi> as to their <hi>principal ultimate end.</hi> The same God is their <hi>End</hi> who is their <hi>Beginning.</hi> The same E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Glory with him, is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased and prepared for them, and intended by them through their Christian course. The wicked have a lower End, even flesh and self: but all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Christ are United in the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:170535:27"/> true intention of this End. They are all the <hi>Heirs of life, and partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light,</hi> and have all <hi>laid up their treasure in Heaven, Matth.</hi> 6. 20, 21. <hi>Colos.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 7. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 7. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 29. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 14. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 6. <hi>All that are risen with Christ, do seek the things that are above,</hi> Colos. 3. 1. <hi>and have their conversation with him in Heaven,</hi> Phil. 3. 20, 21.</p>
               <p n="5">5. All the Members of the Catholick Gospel Church have <hi>One Gospel</hi> to teach them the knowledge of Christ, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 10, 11. and One Word of promise to be the charter of their inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 22, 29. and <hi>One</hi> holy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to be the instrument of their regeneration, and the <hi>seed of God abiding in them,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 23, 25. Luk. 8. 11. It is but <hi>One</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:170535:28"/> that God hath appointed for them; and it is <hi>One</hi> in the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance that is the instrument of their change.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It is <hi>One kind of faith,</hi> that by this <hi>One</hi> holy Doctrine is wrought upon their souls. Though the <hi>Degrees</hi> be various, yet all believe the same Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial points of faith, with a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the same nature. <hi>There is One faith,</hi> Eph. 4. 5. And in all these <hi>Essentials,</hi> the Church is of <hi>One mind,</hi> Joh. 17. 21. Act. 4. 32. 1 Pet. 3. 8. 1 Cor. 15. 2, 3, 4. though in lesser things there be exceeding great diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity.</p>
               <p n="7">7. There is <hi>One new disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or holy nature</hi> wrought by the Spirit of God in every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Catholick Church. This is called their <hi>Holinesse,</hi> and the <hi>New creature,</hi> and the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> and the <hi>Image</hi>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:170535:28"/>
                  <hi>of God,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 16. 2 Pet. 1. 4. John 3. 6. <hi>That which is born of the Spirit, is Spirit.</hi> Col. 3. 10. 2 Cor. 5. 17.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The <hi>Affections</hi> which are <hi>predominant</hi> in all the Members of the Church, have <hi>One and the same object. Sinne</hi> is the chiefest thing that all of them hate; and the <hi>displeasure of God</hi> the chief thing they <hi>fear,</hi> and <hi>God in Christ</hi> is the prime object of their <hi>love,</hi> and they have all the same ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their <hi>Desires</hi> and <hi>Hopes,</hi> even the <hi>favour of God,</hi> and <hi>everlasting life:</hi> and they all chiefly rejoyce in the same hopes and felicity; as were easie to manifest and prove in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, as to all the Essentials of Christianity that are the objects of the will, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 27. &amp; 2. 3. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 37, 38. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9. And thus they are all of <hi>One heart</hi>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:170535:29"/> and <hi>soul,</hi> as uniting in the same objects.</p>
               <p n="9">9. They have also all <hi>One Rule or Law to live by:</hi> which is the <hi>Law of faith, of grace, of liberty, of Christ,</hi> Rom. 3. 27. &amp; 8. 2. Jam. 1. 25. Galat. 6. 2. And as <hi>One Law</hi> is <hi>appointed</hi> for them all, so <hi>One Law</hi> in the points of <hi>absolute necessity</hi> is <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi> by them all; for <hi>it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in their hearts,</hi> and <hi>put into their inward parts,</hi> Jer. 31. 32. Heb. 8. 10, 16. Though in the other points of the Law of Christ, there be much diversity in their reception and obedience. All of them are sincerely obedient to what they know, and all of them know that which God hath made of necessity to life.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Every Member of the Church is Devoted to God in <hi>One and the same Covenant.</hi> As the Covenant on Christs part is
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:170535:29"/> One to them all; so is it <hi>One</hi> on their part. They all renounce the world, the flesh and Devil, and give up themselves to God the Father, Son and holy Ghost. And this being used by Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, to be solemnly done in Baptism; therefore <hi>Baptism</hi> is called the <hi>Principle</hi> or <hi>foundation, Heb.</hi> 6. 1. And there is said to be <hi>but One Baptism,</hi> Ephes. 4. 5. and <hi>Baptism</hi> is said <hi>to save us,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. <hi>Not the putting away the filth of the flesh</hi> (that is, not the outward washing) <hi>but the answer of a good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God;</hi> that is, the sincere internal Covenant of the heart, and delivering up our selves to Christ; so also the Fathers, when they (usually) speak of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of Baptism, they mean principally our <hi>becoming Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and entering into the holy Covenant which was done by
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:170535:30"/> Baptism. Though if any be so weak as to think, that this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Baptism is to be delayed (as <hi>Constantine,</hi> and many of the Fathers did) if in the mean time he make and profess his Covenant with Christ, he is to be taken as a Christian and Church-member: but as a soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier without colours, or a King not crowned; he is a Christian not orderly admitted, which is his sin.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Every Member of the Catholick Church hath the <hi>same Instrumental Founders of his faith under Christ,</hi> that is, <hi>the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apostles,</hi> infallibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired by the holy Ghost. <hi>We are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner stone; in whom all the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fitly framed together, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto an holy temple in the Lord,</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:170535:30"/>
                  <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 20, 21. These were the eye-witnesses of the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christ, and the ear-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of his holy Doctrine, who have delivered it to us, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Miracles of the holy Ghost, by Christ, and by themselves. And though possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly some ignorant Christian may not well understand his relation to these founders of his faith, yet from them he had it, and is thus related to them: and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly this is understood and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by them.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Every Member of the Church is <hi>related to all the Body, as a member of it:</hi> and are <hi>no more strangers and sojourners, but fellow citizens of the Saints, and of the houshold of God,</hi> Eph. 2. 19. But this the vary term it self doth sufficiently import to you.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Every Member of the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:170535:31"/> Church hath an <hi>habitual love to each particular Member of the same Church.</hi> Though mistakes and infirmities may occasion fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings out, even as with <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> to a parting; and there may be dislikes and bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness against one another upon misunderstandings, and not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Gods graces in each other; yet still <hi>as Christians</hi> they are heartily loved by each other; and did they know more of the truth of each others Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, they would love each other more. Every member is United by Love to the rest; for this is a lesson that is <hi>taught</hi> us inwardly of <hi>God: And by this we know, that we are translated from death to life,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 22. 1 John 3. 11, 14, 23. &amp; 4. 12, 20, 21, 8. 1 Thess. 4. 9. Joh. 13. 34, 35.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Every Member of the Church hath a <hi>special Love to the</hi>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:170535:31"/>
                  <hi>whole,</hi> and desire after the Churches welfare and prosperity. Yea their Love to the Body ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth their love to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular members, <hi>Psal.</hi> 122. 2. And therefore they desire and pray for its safety and increase.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Every Member of the Church hath a <hi>special Love to the more noble sort of Members.</hi> As every man is more carefull of the heart, the stomack, the lungs, the liver, then of his finger, so are Christians as Christians in greatest Love to those that have most of Christ in them, and on whom the Churches welfare doth most depend, of them are they most solicitous, so far as they understand it. This is true both of mens Graces, Gifts and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. He that loveth Grace, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth those most that have most Grace. And he that loveth the Church, honoureth those in a
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:170535:32"/> special manner whom he discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth best gifted for the benefit of the Church, and to imploy his gifts most faithfully thereto. And though I will not say, but it's possible for some Christians to be converted by a private man, and die before they know a Church-officer, and for some weak ones in a temptation to deny and disclaim, or quarrel with their Officers; yet so far as any true Christian is acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the necessity or useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Ministry to the Churches good, and Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour (as ordinarily all know it in some measure; and they that know it not, are in some fit of a phrensie) so far they cannot choose but love and honour them. And thus far all Christians joyn for the Ministry: As <hi>Gods</hi> inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was for all their good in giving <hi>Pastors, Teachers</hi> and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:170535:32"/>
                  <hi>Gifts</hi> of special service for the Church, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 11, 12, 13, 14.</p>
               <p n="16">16. All Members have an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward inclination to hold commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with fellow-members,</hi> so far as they discern them to be Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers indeed. As fire would to fire, and water would to water, and earth to earth, and every thing to its like; so Christians would have actual communion with Christians, as delighting in each other, and loving Christ in each other, and finding benefit by each others communion. Though I know that this incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation may be much kept from execution, and communion much hindred, by mistakes about the nature, and manner, and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites of it, and by infirmities and passions of our own. Brethren may fall out; but there is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in them a brotherly love,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:170535:33"/> and when the mistake or passion is over, they will get together again, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 32, 33. &amp; 2. 42, 44. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 25. <hi>Psalm</hi> 16. 3.</p>
               <p n="17">17. There is in every true Member of the Church an <hi>inward Inclination and propensity to all the instituted means of grace,</hi> and a suitableness of spirit to them, which fitteth them to relish them and highly to value them: And ordinarily this disposition is brought forth into act. The Word of God is <hi>engraffed</hi> or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturalized to them, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 21. It is to them as <hi>milk</hi> to the <hi>new born babe,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 1, 2. The Lords Supper is sweet to him, as representing Christ sacrified, and offering him Christ the food of the soul, and affording him special communion with the Saints. <hi>For the cup of blessing which we blesse, is the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:170535:33"/>
                  <hi>of the bloud of Christ; and the bread which we break is the communion of the body of Christ; For we being many are one bread, and one body; for we are all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of that one bread,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 16, 17. The same holy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposition have they to prayer, confession, the praises of God, and all other parts of his service. Though it's too true, that as diseases may put our mouths out of relish to our meat; so tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations may bring some Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians to mistakes about some Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, especially as to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and so may make them guilty of too long forbearance of them.</p>
               <p n="18">18. So also every Member of the Church hath in the main the <hi>same holy imploiment and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,</hi> that is, <hi>The service of God,</hi> so farre as they know his will, is the business of their
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170535:34"/> lives, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1. <hi>We are his workmanship created to good works in Christ Jesus,</hi> Ephes. 2. 10, 11.</p>
               <p n="19">19. And every Member hath an <hi>inward enmity to that which is destructive to it self, or to the body,</hi> so farre as he knoweth it, that is, 1. To sinne in general. 2. To all known sinne in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular: And, 3. Specially to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions, distractions and diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church. These things their inward disposition is against; and when they are led to them, it is by temptation producing mistakes and passions against the <hi>bent</hi> of their hearts and lives. Thus abhorre that which is destructive to the body, as such.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Lastly, They shall all at the end of their course obtain <hi>the same Crown of glory, and see, and enjoy the same blessed God</hi>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:170535:34"/>
                  <hi>and glorified Redeemer,</hi> and be Members of the same celestial <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and imployed everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stingly in the same holy Love, and Joy, and Praise, and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie, and Please the Lord in all, and Center, and be United per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly in him, <hi>John</hi> 17. 21, 23, 24. <hi>For of him, and through him, and to him are all things, to whom be Glory for ever, Amen.

               <p>And thus I have shewed you in twenty particulars the <hi>Ʋnity of the Saints;</hi> though it is not from every one of these that they are called <hi>One Church,</hi> yet all these are inseparable as to <hi>Possession</hi> from the true Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and as to <hi>Profession</hi> from the seeming Members that are adult.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ʋse.</hi> 1. The truth being thus plain and certain as it is, That the Catholick Church is <hi>One,</hi> and consisteth of true Christians, as its real living Members, and of all Professors of true Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as its Visible Members; we have here too great occasion of sad lamentation, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ignorance of the contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the world, about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the great inconsiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and abuse of this unquesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable verity. To four sorts of people I shall direct my expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stulations: 1. To the <hi>Seekers,</hi> or whoever else deny the very Being of the Catholick Church. 2. To the blind contending par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of these times, and the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended ignorant people, that are much perplexed among so many pretenders, to know, which is
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:170535:35"/> the Church. 3. To the several Sects that would appropriate the Church to themselves only. 4. To the Papists that ask us for a proof of the continued visibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of our Church, and where it was before <hi>Luther.</hi> To these in order. And</p>
               <p>First, For the <hi>Seekers,</hi> because it is not their persons that I have to speak against, but the errors which they are said to hold, and because they purposely hide their opinions, and because I meet with them of so many minds, I shall therefore deal only with the Opinions commonly suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be theirs, not determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning whether indeed they are theirs, or no: for I care not who maintains them, so I do but effectually confute them. And here are four degrees of this errour supposed to be held by the <hi>Seekers.</hi> 1. Some of them
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:170535:36"/> are said to deny the <hi>Ʋniversal mystical Church it self.</hi> 2. Some are said to deny only the <hi>Ʋni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal visible Church as such.</hi> 3. Some yeelding both these, deny <hi>the Ʋniversal Church as Political onely.</hi> 4. Some onely deny <hi>the truth of particular Churches, as Political,</hi> that is, <hi>the truth of the Ministry.</hi> Of these in order.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let that man that questio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the being of the Catholick mystical Church, and yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to believe in Christ, read but these three or four Arguments and blush.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. If there be no such Universal Church, then there are no Christians: For what is the Church but all the Christians of the world? And I pray enquire better, whether there be any Christians in the world or not? Read the Church History, and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:170535:36"/> the books of the Infidels, and see whether there have been <hi>Christians</hi> in the world since the Apostles? He that believeth not that there are <hi>Christians</hi> in the world, when he dwels among them, and daily converseth with them, deserveth to be otherwise disputed with then by argument. He hath only cause to doubt, whether there be any <hi>Christian Magistrate</hi> in this part of the world, that such as he are suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to rave against Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>And certainly he that thinks there are no Christians in the world, is none himself, nor would not be thought one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. If there be no <hi>Church,</hi> there is no <hi>Christ;</hi> no <hi>Body,</hi> no <hi>Head:</hi> no <hi>Kingdome,</hi> no <hi>King:</hi> no <hi>Wife,</hi> no <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band:</hi> no <hi>redeemed ones,</hi> no <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer</hi> or <hi>Mediator.</hi> Though
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:170535:37"/> the Person of Christ should be the same; yet the Office and Relation must cease, if the Church cease. This is beyond all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute. And if this be your mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that there is no Christ, no Mediator, no Head, or Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or King of the Church, speak out and call your selves Infidels as you are.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. If there be no Church or Christians, then there's no <hi>Salvation:</hi> For <hi>Salvation</hi> is <hi>promised</hi> to none but <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> or members of Christ. He is the <hi>Saviour of his Body,</hi> Eph. 5. 23. And he that thinks there's none on earth that shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, it seems expecteth no sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation himself: And how much the world is beholden to him for his Doctrine, and how rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy they will be to receive it, if they be in their wits, is easie to be conjectured.</p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:170535:37"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. If there be no <hi>Church,</hi> there is no <hi>pardon of sinne,</hi> or <hi>adoption,</hi> nor any fruit of the promise. For the Church only are the heirs of promise, pardoned, adopted (I would heap up plain Scriptures for these things, if I thought it to any purpose.) And he that thinks the promises are ceased, and the pardon of sinne, and Adoption ceased, doth sure think the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel and Christianity are ceased, or never were.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to the second Opinion, let them that deny the <hi>Church as visible,</hi> consider of the same Arguments again with the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary addition, and be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. If there be no <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Church,</hi> there are <hi>no Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Christians.</hi> For Christians are the Church: And if there are no <hi>visible Christians,</hi> then no man
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:170535:38"/> can say, that there <hi>are</hi> any <hi>Christians</hi> at all: For how do you know it, if they are not vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. And consequently no man can tell that there is a Christ, the Head and King of the Church: For who can judge of that which is inevident? And if you know not that there's a Church, you cannot know that there's a Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. And thus you must be <hi>uncert. in</hi> of any to be saved; because they are not vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. And you must be uncertain of the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the force of the promise, and of pardon, and sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. Experience and sense it self confutes you. Open your eyes and ears: Do you not see Christians in holy exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises?
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:170535:38"/> Do you not hear them make profession of their faith? It's a fine world, when we must be fain to dispute, whether there be such a people whom we eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day converse and talk with? You may better question, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any <hi>Turkes</hi> or <hi>Jewes</hi> in the world? and as well question, Whether there be any men in the world? And how should such be dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with?</p>
               <p n="3">3. For the third Opinion, which yields a <hi>Ʋniversal visible Church,</hi> but not a <hi>Political,</hi> it is a gross contradiction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> Where there is a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, and Subjects, and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and such as are under his Rule, there is a Political body or Society. For the <hi>Pars im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perans,</hi> and <hi>Pars subdita,</hi> do constitute every Commonwealth: And the Relations of these two
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:170535:39"/> parties, the Ruling part, and the Ruled part, is the form of the Republick. This is undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. But here are these two parts: For Christ is the Ruling part, and the Church or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians are the Ruled part: and therefore you must either deny, that there is a Christ to be King, or that there are Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans his Subjects, or else you must confesse a Political Church.</p>
               <p>But some of this Opinion say, <hi>[We confesse there is a visible Body headed by Christ, who is to us invisible, though visible in the Heavens; but this makes not the Church to be visibly Political, unlesse</hi> secundum quid; <hi>but here is no visible Ʋniversal Head.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. We perceive now whereabout you are, and from whom, and for whom you fetch your Arguments. You must have
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:170535:39"/> a <hi>Pope</hi> it seems, or else no <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Politicàl Church:</hi> We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that either <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>General Councel</hi> are the visible <hi>Heads</hi> of the Church. We maintain that the Church is no otherwise visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible in its Policy, then in these respects. 1. As the <hi>Body</hi> is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, and their obedience. 2. As the <hi>Laws</hi> are visible by which they are governed. 3. As the <hi>inferiour Officers</hi> or Ministers are visible. And, 4. As <hi>Christ the Head</hi> is visible in Heaven. There is no other visibility of Polity to be here expected.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The next Opinion denieth only, That <hi>there are any true particular Political Churches.</hi> Against this I argue thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. If there be no <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> Churches there is no <hi>Ʋ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal Church:</hi> For there can be no <hi>whole,</hi> if there be no <hi>parts:</hi> And Political particular
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:170535:40"/> Churches are those principal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutive parts of the Universal, which the Scripture mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. But I have proved, that there is an Universal Church, which is the whole: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there are particular politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Churches, which are the parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. If there be <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Christian Societies with Overseers,</hi> then there are parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Political Churches: For a Church hath but two Essential parts; the <hi>Guiding</hi> or <hi>Ruling</hi> part, which is the Elders or O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verseers, and the <hi>Guided</hi> and <hi>Ruled</hi> part, which are the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Now here are both these: Therfore there are particular Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Churches. That here are <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Assemblies</hi> me thinks I should not need to prove, to men that see them day by day, and plead against them. The
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170535:40"/> only Question therefore remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, Whether the Elders or Teachers be true Officers or Elders, or not? And in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot, this is all the Question, and you can stick on no other (nor well on this) without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring your selves to be Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels: And this is a Question that belongs not to this place, but I purposely refer you to what I have already published hereupon.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <p n="2">II. My next address is, <hi>To them that are so sollicitous to know, which is the true Church among all the parties in the world that pretend to it.</hi> Silly souls! they are hearkning to this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to that party, and turn it may be to one, and to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to find the true Universal Church: I speak not in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170535:41"/> but in compassion: but I must say, you deal much liker Bedlams than Christians, or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable men. You runne up and down from room to room to find the house; and you ask, Is the Parlour it, or is the Hall it, or is the Kitchin, or the cole-house it? Why every one is a part of it; and all the rooms make up the house. You are in the wood, and cannot find it for trees: But you ask, Which of these sort of trees is the wood? Is it the Oak, or the Ash, or the Elm, or Poplar, or is it the haw-thorn, or the bramble? Why it is all together. You are studying, which of the members is the man: Is the hand the man, or is it the foot, or is it the eye, or the heart? or which is it? Why it is the whole body and soul, in which all parts and faculties are comprized. You
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:170535:41"/> wisely ask, <hi>Which part is the whole?</hi> Why <hi>no part is the whole?</hi> Which is the Catholick Church? Is it the Protestants, the <hi>Calvin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ists,</hi> or <hi>Lutherans,</hi> the <hi>Papists,</hi> the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> or which is it? Why it is never an one of them, but all together that are truly Christians. Good Lord! What a pitifull state is the poor Church in, when we must look abroad and see such abundance running up and down the world, and asking, which is the world? whether this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey be the world, or that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey be the world? They are as it were running up and down <hi>England</hi> to look for <hi>England,</hi> and ask, whether this Town be <hi>England,</hi> or whether it be the other. They are as men running up and down <hi>London</hi> to enquire for <hi>London,</hi> and ask, whether this house be <hi>London,</hi> or that
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:170535:42"/> Street be <hi>London,</hi> or some other. Thus are they in the midst of the Church of Christ enquiring after the Church, and asking, Whether it be this party of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, or whether it be the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Why you doting wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, it is all Christians in the world of what sort soever, that are truly so, that constitute the Catholick Church.</p>
               <p>Indeed if your Question were only, <hi>Which is the purest, or soundest, or safest part of the Church,</hi> then there were some sense in it, and I could quickly give you advice for your reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; (but that is reserved for a following part of the Discourse) If you only ask, Whether the Parlour or the cole-house be the <hi>better part</hi> or room of the house? or whether the Oak or the bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble be the <hi>better part</hi> of the wood? I should soon give you
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:170535:42"/> an answer. So if you ask, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Protestants,</hi> or <hi>Papists,</hi> or <hi>Greeks,</hi> be the sounder part of the Church? I should soon answer you. The same family may have in it both infants and men at age, sound men and sick men; some that have but small distempers, and some that have the plague or leprosie: and yet all are men, and members of the family. And so hath the Church of God such members.</p>

He that hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth fast the essentials of Religion by a practical belief, shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by it, though he hold any opinions which <hi>consequentially</hi> subvert the truth, and doth <hi>not understand</hi> that they do subvert it. For this is the best mens case. But if he so hold the errour, as seeing that it overthrows an es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential point, and so holdeth not that point which it is against, this man is not a Christian. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very drop of water is contrary to fire, and yet a great fire is not put out by a single drop.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:170535:44"/> Every degree of sickness, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural decay hath a contrariety to health and life: and yet every man is not dead that is sick; nor any man, I think: nor is it every sickness that procureth death. The promise is, <hi>He that believeth shall be saved:</hi> and therefore as long as he <hi>believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> all the <hi>essential</hi> verities, it is no contrary opinion that can unchristen him, or unchurch him.</p>

Why man, hast not thou as much need of tender indulgence and mercy thy self, to keep thee in the Church, and in the favour of God, and bring thee to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as <hi>Anabaptists, Separatists, Arminians, Lutherans,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such Sects have, to continue them in the number of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Christians?

                  <p>I beseech you therefore poor peevish quarrelsome souls, give others leave to live in the same house with you: Do not disown your Brethren, and say, they are bastards, because they somewhat differ from you in complexion, in age, in strength, in health, in stature, or any of the points wherein I told you a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the members of the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:170535:47"/> Church do usually differ in. Shew not your selves so igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant or froward, as to make a wonder of it, that God should be the Father both of infants, and men at age, of weak and strong, and that the sick and the sound should both be in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. Doth such cruelty beseem the brest of a Christian, as to wish God to cast out all his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren from his family, that are weak and sick? Do not make it such a matter of wonder, that Gods house should have many rooms in it; and think it not a reproach to it, that the Kitchin or the Cole-house is part of the house. Wonder not at it as a strange thing, that all the body is not a hand or eye; and that some parts have less honour and comeliness than the rest.

               <p n="3">III. My next address is to those several Sects (I call them not so in reproach, but because they make themselves so) that sinfully appropriate the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church to themselves. Thus did the <hi>Donatists</hi> in <hi>Augustines</hi> time, to whom he gives a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of very great use to all that are guilty of that sinne in our dayes. But I shall only speak particularly now to these three Sects, that are most noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously guilty: 1. The <hi>Quakers.</hi> 2. Some <hi>Anabaptists.</hi> And, 3. The <hi>Papists.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Quakers</hi> are but a few
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170535:48"/> distempered people, risen up within a very few years, in this corner of the world: and yet they are not ashamed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the most godly Christians, Ministers and Churches of the world that are not of their way; as if the Church were confined to these few poor distracted er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous persons. I do not think that they are all of a mind a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselves; some of them plainly deny the very essentials of Christianity. And for these to reproach the Church is no wonder: But to appropriate it to themselves, that are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves no members of it, is as if <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>Heathens</hi> should have perswaded the world, that they are the only Christians. In the mean time, I thank God that Christianity is in so much esteem, that even the enemies of it do pretend to it: But for those
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:170535:48"/> that go under that name, and deny not the Fundamentals; let them consider what I said before to the <hi>Seekers:</hi> If there be no Church there is no Christ? No Body, no Head? And no Church, no Christians; and no Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Salvation. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I would know of them, Where was the true Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the other day that the <hi>Quakers</hi> rose? If there were <hi>any,</hi> where was it? If there were <hi>none,</hi> then there was no Christ, no Head? I remember what a Boy told them lately near us <hi>[Your Church and Religion</hi> (saith he) <hi>cannot be the right, for I can remember since it first begun]</hi> Sure Christ had a Church before the <hi>Quakers.</hi>

            <div type="part">
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>rigid Anabaptists</hi> do runne the same strain, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:170535:49"/> the Church to their <hi>Sect</hi> alone; and this upon the Popish conceit, That Baptism is either necessary to salvation, or else to the being of a member of the Church: None but the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized, or those that are Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized at age, are taken by them to be members of the Church: (Though I know that many of the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> are more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and make Rebaptizing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary only in point of <hi>duty,</hi> and <hi>ad bene esse.)</hi> Of these men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so I would know, 1. Where was a Church that was against Infant-Baptism, since the dayes of the Apostles (much less among them) till within this 500 or 600 years at most (perhaps this 200 or 300?) Had Christ a visible Church of such in all ages? If so, tell us where it was, and prove it. If not, tell us, how Christ could be a King without a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:170535:49"/> a Head without a body. 2. And can your hearts endure so cruel a Doctrine, as to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church all the Churches of the world, except so few, and such as you? 3. And would you have men in their wits believe, that Christ hath been so many hundred years without a visible Church? Or that his Church hath had a false constitution, and that now he is constituting his Church aright in the end of the world? 4. Your errour is so much the greater and more cruel, as your party is the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and more lately sprung up; that ever it can enter into your hearts to imagine that God hath no Church in all the world but you. But I shall say no more to you particularly, partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you are an impatient ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, that take a confutation for a persecution; and partly,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:170535:50"/> because I shall offend the more sober, by such needless words, to so gross an errour; and chiefly because that which I shall speak to the next party, will be also usefull to your informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <p n="3">3. The principal Sect that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate the Church to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, is the <hi>Papists.</hi> And to them I shall more largely open my mind. They make a great noise against all other parties with the name of the <hi>Roman Catholick Church,</hi> and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident ostentation that it is only they. They make the Pope the visible Head of it, and exclude all from the Church, besides his Subjects: and all that are not of that Church they exclude also from salvation, with an <hi>extra Ecclesiam nulla salus.</hi> What
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:170535:50"/> shall we say to these things?</p>
               <p n="1">1. Sure it must needs be some admirable qualification that must thus advance the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to be the whole and only Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church? And what should this be? Is it their extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>holinesse?</hi> I know they talk much of the Holiness of their Church: But they dare not put it upon that issue, and let us take that for the Church which we find to be most holy. On those terms I think we should soon be resolved, by a little ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation and experience. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it would not serve their turn, unless they could prove that none are Holy at all but they. What then is the ground of this pretended Priviledge? Why because they take the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> for the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Bishop, and are under his government. And is this it
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:170535:51"/> that salvation is confined to.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And sure it must be some very hainous matter that all the rest of the Christian world must be unchurcht and damned for: And what is that? Is it for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying any Article of the faith? Which is it that we deny? When they would set them against <hi>Protestants,</hi> they boast that the <hi>Greeks</hi> are in all things of their mind, except the Popes Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy: And therefore this is the only Heresie that might unchurch and damn them. And it is not for <hi>ungodlinesse;</hi> for we are ready to joyn with them in severer censures of <hi>ungodlinesse,</hi> then we know how to bring them to. The damning crime is, That we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the Mistress of all the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and the Pope to be their Head. And indeed, is this a <hi>damning sinne,</hi> and inconsistent
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:170535:51"/> with Christianity, or Church-membership? I prove the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, <hi>That the Catholick Church is not confined to the Romane, but containeth in it all</hi> that I have mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>Argum. 1. <hi>If many are true Christians that believe not in the Pope, or Romane Church, as the Ruler of the rest, then many may be Church-members and saved, that believe not in them: But the Antecedent is certain.</hi> For</p>
               <p n="1">1. He that truly believes in God the Father, Sonne and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, renouncing the flesh, the world and the Devil, is a Christian: But so do many mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions that believe not in the Pope or <hi>Romane</hi> Sovereignty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>He that hath the sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit of Christ is a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an:</hi> For Christ giveth it to no other: <hi>But so have millions that</hi>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:170535:52"/>
                  <hi>believe not the Romane Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty,</hi> as I shall further shew anon.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Those that have all that's essential to a Christian, are true Christians: But so have millions that believe not the Romane So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty.</hi> For they have Faith, Hope, Charity, Repentance and sincere Obedience: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are true Christians. If you say, That the belief of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> Sovereignty is essential to Christianity, you must well prove it, which yet was never done.</p>
               <p>I prove the contrary by many Arguments:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>No Scripture tels us, that your Sovereignty is a truth, much lesse of the essence of Christianity. Therefore it is not so to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi> What <hi>Bellarmine</hi> brings but to prove the truth of it, I have manifested to be utterly
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:170535:52"/> impertinent in my Book against Popery.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>If it had been essential to Christianity, and necessary to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, to believe the Sovereignty of the Church of Rome, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles would have preached it to all the people, whose conversion they endeavoured, and have sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished the Churches in it: But there is not a word in Scripture, or any Church History that ever the Apostles, or any Preachers of those times, did teach the people any such Doctrine:</hi> much lesse that they taught it <hi>all</hi> the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And sure they would not have omitted a point of <hi>necessity to salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>If the Sovereignty of the Pope, or of Rome, is of necessity to Christianity and Salvation, then the Apostles and Pastors of the Primitive Church, would either have baptized men into the Pope</hi>

                  <hi>and Romane Church, or at least have instructed their Catechumens in it, and required them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse their belief in the Pope and Romane Church.</hi> But there is not a word in Scripture, or any Church records, intimating that ever such a thing was once done either by Orthodox or Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; that ever any did baptize men into the name of the Pope or <hi>Romane Church,</hi> or did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of them a confession of the <hi>Romane Sovereignty;</hi> no nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver taught any Church or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian to obey the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the Ruler of other Churches. <hi>Paul</hi> was more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly an Apostle at <hi>Rome</hi> (a Bishop they call him) then <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and you may know his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice by 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 14, 15. <hi>[I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius, lest any should say, that I baptized in my</hi>

               <p n="4">4. <hi>If the Sovereignty of the Romane Church were necessary to Christianity and salvation; we should have had it in some of the Creeds of the Primitive Church, or at least in the Exposition of those Creeds. But there we have no such thing.</hi> For their affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, That the word <hi>[Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church]</hi> in the Creed, signifieth as much as <hi>[the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Catholick Church]</hi> doth signifie no more to us, but the dreaming ungrounded confidence of the affirmers.</p>

               <p n="6">6. <hi>If it be an Article of Faith, and so essential to Christianity, that Rome is the mistresse of other Churches, then either it was so before there was a Church at Rome, or else it begun after.

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:170535:54"/> was a Church at <hi>Rome,</hi> as it was for many years before. And the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> is the same thing. It was many years a <hi>Catholick Church</hi> before there was any Church at <hi>Rome</hi> at all.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>If it be necessary to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity or Salvation, to believe that Rome is the Mistresse and Head of the Catholick Church, then it is as necessary to know who it is that is this Head and Mistresse; whether it be the Pope, or the particular Church of Rome, or the General Council.</hi> For else the <hi>bare name</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> should be the thing of necessity. But if we know not what that name doth signifie, it's no more to us then a <hi>non-</hi>sense word, which a Parrot may utter. But what it is that is this Head or Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty the Papists themselves are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly disagreed in. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil

The <hi>Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rane</hi> Council thought otherwise: And <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Council <hi>[judged the Judge of the whole world]</hi> and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the Pope to be the Head and Seat of Sovereignty. The <hi>Italians</hi> go one way, and the <hi>French</hi> another. But if these be true General Councils, then the matter is determined against the Pope, and therefore is is an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Faith, to be believed on pain of damnation, that the Council is above the Pope: And yet it is also an Article of Faith to be believed on the same pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty, that the Pope is above the General Council: for the Council at the <hi>Laterans</hi> under <hi>Leo</hi> 10. hath determined it,

But they say, <hi>That it determined only that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil is above the Pope in case of a Schism, when the true Pope is not known.</hi> But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> durst not stand to this answer: For the express words of the Council are, that <hi>[A General Council hath immediate Authority from Christ, which all are bound to obey, though of Papal Dignity.]</hi> Can plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:170535:56"/> words be spoke? But <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi> other shift is worse <hi>[That P.</hi> Martin 5. <hi>confirmed all that was done in this Council,</hi> conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liariter; <hi>but this</hi> (saith he) <hi>was not</hi> conciliariter.] See what jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Articles of the Romish Faith are liable to, and how clear an interpreter of Scriptures, and decider of controversies we have, that speaks so enigmatically, when he seems to speak most plainly, even in confirming a General Council, that his own Cardinals, nor the Council it self, are not able to understand him. But perhaps the Council at the <hi>Laterane</hi> was false, that determineth of the contrary, That the Pope is above Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils: No, not in the judgement of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and his party. For <hi>(Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Concil. cap.</hi> 17.) he saith, That <hi>Vix dici potest, it can scarce be said that the</hi>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:170535:56"/>
                  <hi>Council was not General.</hi> And the Pope was in it and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and the <hi>non-</hi>reception of it by others, he saith is nothing, because Decrees of faith are immutable, and the not receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cannot change them. What a case then are they in, that must needs be damned? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they believe the Pope to be the supream, or the Council to be the supream? One Council is against one way, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther against the other way, and both Councils confirmed by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Popes. But yet they have a remedy, and that is, <hi>That yet the matter is doubtfull:</hi> And where is the doubt? <hi>Why it is, whether the Council defined this as an Article of faith, or no?</hi> And therefore saith <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, [They are not properly Hereticks that hold the contrary, but cannot be excused from great</hi>

                  <hi>timerity.]</hi> So that you see what certainty the Papists are at in their faith. It cannot be known, nor will any succeeding Popes determine it, when a Council hath decided a point, whether or no they intended it as an Article of Faith (And yet in the <hi>Trent</hi> Oath they are to swear obedience <hi>[To all things defined and declared by the sacred Canons and Oecumenical Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils.)]</hi> One Council Decrees, That the <hi>Pope</hi> is highest, and another or two Decree, That the <hi>Council</hi> is highest, and the Pope must obey them: yea both these are confirmed by the Pope. The Subjects are sworn to obey both contradictories: And yet after this contrary decision, the case is still undecided with them, and for fear of losing half their party, they dare not say, that either are <hi>Properly</hi> Hereticks
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:170535:57"/> (mark <hi>Properly.)</hi> Yea (saith <hi>Bellarmine, de Concil. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 13.) <hi>[Though afterwards in the Florentine and Laterane Council the Question seems to be defined</hi> (having before been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily defined at <hi>Constance</hi> and <hi>Basil) yet to this day it remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a Question among Catholicks, because the Council of Florence seems not to define it so expresly: and of the Council of Laterane, which most expresly defined it, some doubt.]</hi> So that as there's no understanding their Councils in their highest Decrees, so we have the Confession of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists themselves, that it is yet undetermined, and no point of faith, <hi>which is the Sovereign Power in the Church:</hi> And if it be not so much as determined, then much lesse is it essential to Christianity. And if it be not necessary to know, Who hath
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:170535:58"/> the Sovereignty, then it cannot be necessary to know, that it is in the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> For the name of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is nothing but a sound, without the thing that's signified by it. Moreover, the Pope is not the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> For it was never heard that one man was call'd a Church: And a general Council is not the Churches of <hi>Rome.</hi> For if there be such a thing, it representeth all Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es as much as <hi>Rome.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which ever be the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, it cannot be the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And as for the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>Romane</hi> Clergy or people, no man that ever I heard of did yet affirm, that it was the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Ruler of the Churches. It is only the Pope and Council that are competitors.</p>
               <p>If any say, That it is the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Council</hi> only conjunct. I
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:170535:58"/> answer, 1. That two that are both fallible, set together, will not make one infallible power. 2. Then the farre greatest part of the Papists are erroneous in holding the contrary. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all make either the Pope, or the Council to be the seat of Supremacy and Infallibility. 3. Then what is become of the Church, when these two disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as frequently they have done. 4. The Pope and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil agreeing do oft contradict a former Pope and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil agreeing do oft contradict a former Pope and Council agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. 5. Then the Church is without a Head, all this while that there is no Council in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. See <hi>Bellarmines</hi> Arguments against this opinion.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Another Argument to prove, that it is not essential to Christianity to believe the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty of the Pope or Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is this, It is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:170535:59"/> to salvation to know that there is such a place as <hi>Rome</hi> in the world, or whether there be one or two, or ten places of that name, or which of them it is that hath the Sovereignty: and therefore it cannot be necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to believe that it is the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick or Mistress Church: would God lay mens salvation upon the title of a City, many thousand miles from some parts of his Church, which they have no knowledge of? Many Papists say, That <hi>Heathens</hi> have suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent means of salvation, that never heard of Christ; and yet will they damn Christians that never heard of the City or Pope of <hi>Rome?</hi> For about three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years after Christ, it was the seat of the greatest Idolatry, impiety, and persecuting cruelty in the world. And would God all that while so advance that
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:170535:59"/> wicked place, as to make it essential to Christianity to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>Rome</hi> to be the seat of the Sovereignty of the Church.</p>
               <p n="9">9. We have no certainty of faith that <hi>Rome</hi> shall not be burnt, or be possessed by <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometanes,</hi> or turn to Infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Therefore we have no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty that it shall be any Church at all, much less the true Ruling, or Catholick Church.</p>
               <p n="10">10. If it were necessary to salvation to believe <hi>Romes</hi> Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, God would afford the world sufficient evidence of it, and commission Preachers to preach it to the world: <hi>For how should they believe without a Preacher, and how shall he preach except he be sent?</hi> But no such Commissions are proved to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to any from the Lord.</p>
               <p>Having thus backt my first
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:170535:60"/> Argument, and proved others besides Papists to be Christians, and consequently members of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, I may proceed to the rest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. If millions besides Papists have the Spirit of God, and true saith, and charity, and holiness, then are they members of the Catholick Church. For out of the Church is no salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but all that have the Holy Ghost and charity, shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as the Papists confess, if they continue in it. But that many besides Papists have charity and Sanctification, we have large experience to perswade us to conclude: For though no man can know the certain truth of another mans profession or heart; yet as far as men can know by one another, we have ground to be exeeeding confident of the Sanctity and Charity of multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:170535:60"/> among us. I profess if it were but this one thing that hindered me, I could not be a Papist upon any terms. I live among humble, holy, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly people, that live in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual breathings after God, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a sinfull thought, in great mortification, and willingness to know Gods will, that they may obey it; and accordingly abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance have ended their lives in peace and joy in the holy Ghost: none of these were Papists: And now it is impossible for a man to be a Papist, that will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all these to be out of the Catholick Church, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to be unsanctified and cond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>mned. And if so, I am resolved never to be Papist. If I cannot be a Papist without condemning a multitude of the Heliest persons that ever I could meet with, and shutting my eyes
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:170535:61"/> against the admirable lustre of their graces, let them be Papists that will for me.</p>

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:170535:62"/> and much more many others have, as I see great reason to believe. Now Popery binds me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that I am void of charity and all saving special Grace, because I believe not in the Pope, that is, to renounce the experience of Gods grace in my soul, and unthankfully to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny all these mercies of God. So that as sure as any Protestant can be of charity or saving grace in himself, so sure may he be that Popery is false Doctrine, and that's enough.</p>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>How much do you wrong and dishonour the Lord Jesus in many respects.</hi> 1. Hath he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased his Church with his own bloud? And now dare you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to rob him of the farre greater part of his purchase, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they be not of your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion? I would not stand before him with the guilt of such a sin for all the world. 2. Dare you charge so great unmercifulness on Christ, that hath so wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully shewed his mercy, and at so dear a rate? After all his

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Your design is against the very nature of the Catholick Church, and the Communion of Saints.</hi> The design of Christ in the work of Redemption was,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:170535:64"/> to gather all into one Body, and bring them to God. To break down the partition wall between <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> and take away the Ordinances and Ceremonies that occasioned the division, and to unite them all in himself the Universal Head, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 13, 14, 15. that he might reconcile both to God in one Body by the Cross, having slain the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity thereby, <hi>vers.</hi> 16, 17.

It was the design of Christ to unite all the differing parts; and you crosse his design, and go about to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate that which he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned and cemented even by his precious bloud. 2. The Church is united and centered in Christ, and knows no other Head: And Papists would set up
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:170535:65"/> a mortal and incapable man, and have all unite in him as a Vicar Head: And having not a word for this from Christ, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert one Text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 21. <hi>The eye cannot say to the hand,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>or the head to the feet, I have no need of you.]</hi> See here (say they) is a visible Head: But 1.

Thus men abuse themselves, when they will dare to wrest the Scripture to their interests. 2. But if it had spoke of one Universal Head, must it needs be the Pope, or an earthly man? I must profess that very Chapter is so full and plain against Popery, that were there no more, I could hardly be a Papist. For mark, I pray you, 1.

                     <hi>be a true Church or no:</hi> To which I give this true and plain answer in brief.</p>
                  <p>The word <hi>Church</hi> signifieth four things (pertinent to our present purpose) 1. The <hi>Ʋni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal or Catholick Church</hi> as <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible:</hi> So the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not the Church at all. 2. The <hi>Ʋniversal Church</hi> as <hi>Invisible:</hi> So the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not the Church. 3. A <hi>Particular Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Church</hi> of Christs instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And, 4. A <hi>Community</hi> or meer Countrey or company of Christians, as part of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church. Now as to these two last, the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth, 1. Either <hi>all the Papists formally</hi> as such, that is, as uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a pretended Universal Bishop. And in this formal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is a false Church, and no true Church at all of Christs appointing. 2. By
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:170535:68"/>
                     <hi>[the Church of Rome]</hi> may be meant, the <hi>persons that live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Papal captivity and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,</hi> not <hi>as his Subjects</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally, but <hi>as Christians,</hi> and the <hi>Subjects of Christ:</hi> And thus all Christians in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are a part of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Church of Christ: A <hi>Part,</hi> and <hi>but a Part,</hi> as <hi>Christians: No Part,</hi> but the <hi>plague of the Church,</hi> as <hi>Papists.</hi> This is the plain truth. Your errours are great and numerous: yet we are willing to extend our charity as farre as is possible, to take you for Brethren: And will you be so froward as to unchurch others, even all the rest of the Christian world, that have need of so much charity to your selves? You cry out of the Heresie of the <hi>Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites, Georgians, Syrians, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians,</hi> &amp;c. Some are <hi>Nesto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> some are <hi>Eutychians,</hi> and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:170535:69"/> I know not what: But woe to <hi>Rome</hi> if worse men, and more erroneous than they, may not be of the Church, and saved. Shall I set down the words of one of your own Monks that dwelt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them in <hi>Judea?</hi> It is <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chardus Descript. Terrae sanct.</hi> 323, 324, 325, 326. <hi>[Sunt in terra promissionis,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>There are in the holy Land</hi> (saith he) <hi>men of every Nation under Heaven: and every Nation liveth after their own Rites: and to speak the truth to our great confusion, there are none found in it that are worse and of more corrupt manners than the Christians</hi> (he means the Papists) <hi>Pag.</hi> 235. he saith, <hi>[Moreover those that we judge to be damned Hereticks, Nestorians, Jacobites, Maronites, Georgians, &amp; the like, I found to be for the most part Good and simple men, and living sincerely towards God and men, of</hi>
                     <pb n="123" facs="tcp:170535:69"/>
                     <hi>great abstinenee,</hi> &amp;c.—And <hi>Pag.</hi> 324. he tells you, <hi>That the Syrians, Nestorians, Nubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Jabeans, Chaldeans, Maro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, Ethiopians, Egyptians, and many other Nations of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians there inhabit, and some are Schismaticks, not subject to the Pope, and others called Hereticks, as the Nestorians, Jacobites,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But</hi> (saith he) <hi>there are many in these Sects exceeding simple</hi> (or plain) <hi>knowing nothing of Heresies, devoted to Christ, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerating the flesh with fastings, and wearing the most simple gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, so that they even far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the very Religious of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus by the testimony of your own eye-witnesses, even these that you cast out for Hereticks and Schismaticks, are farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond even the the Religious of your Church: What then are
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:170535:70"/> the Reformed Churches? Truly Sirs, it's intollerable for the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour</hi> to say <hi>[I am all the house]</hi> but for the Chimney, Kitchin, or Cole-house, it is more intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable. If your chief servant shall say, the rest are no ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, it is not well: but for the scullion or groom to say so is worse. If the Oak say <hi>[I am the whole wood]</hi> it is ill: But if the <hi>bramble</hi> say so, it is worse. If the best of your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren should say, that all the rest are bastards, it is not well: but if the most vicious and deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed say so, it is worse.</p>
                  <p>And as you are unfit for qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to exclude all others, so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so for number you are very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. As for the Anabaptists, and such inconsiderable parties, that are not past the thousandth part of the Church, or perhaps the many thousandth part of it
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:170535:70"/> (when yet the whole visible Church is supposed to be but the sixth part of the world) I do admire how any Christian can make himsef believe, that the love and grace of Christ, is confined to so narrow a room, and his Church so small. I think he that believeth once that Christ hath not one of so many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands, is next to believing that he hath no Church at all, &amp; conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that there is no Christ at all.</p>
                  <p>And for the Papists, how deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly also are they guilty in this? As I said, in their greatest height now, they are not near one half the Christians in the world: A great part of their Church are the poor <hi>Americans,</hi> whom they drive to Baptism, as cattel to the water, (yet not leaving it to their choice so much as to drink when they come thither:) So that their own Writers tell us,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:170535:71"/> That multitudes of them know nothing of Christianity, but the name, and many forget that too. A while ago the Papists were but a small part of the Church, before <hi>Tenduc, Nubia,</hi> and other Kingdoms fell away. One of their own Bishops, and a Legate there resident speaks upon his own knowledge of the state of the Church in the East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern parts, <hi>That in the Easterly parts of Asia alone, the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans exceeded in multitudes both the Greeks and Latine Churches. Jacob a Vitriaco Histor. Oriental. cap.</hi> 77. And a most learned Writer of their own <hi>(Melch. Canus Loc. Theol. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. <hi>fol.</hi> 201.) saith, <hi>Pugnatum est,</hi> &amp;c.<hi>—Both the Greeks and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all the rest of the Bishops of the whole world, did vehemently fight, to destroy the Priviledge of the Romane Church: And they</hi>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:170535:71"/>
                     <hi>had on their side both the Arms of Emperours, and the greater number of Churches, and yet they could never bring it to passe, that the Power of this one Romane Pope should be abrogated.]</hi> You see here by their own most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press confession, which way the most of the Churches went, and that almost all or most of all the Bishops of the world were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them; (and so where our Church was before <hi>Luther:)</hi> And yet are these men a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent number to condemn all the rest of the Churches of Christ, and appropriate all the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church to themselves? O what a world of faction do we live in! I am bitterly censured on one side for believing that any Papists are parts of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church: And on the other side we cannot perswade the Papists, that any other are
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:170535:72"/> parts of it but they: And so they will needs be either the whole Church, or none of it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. This factious course of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churching all Christians saving your selves, is <hi>contrary to the very internal nature of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi> Every Christian as a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, is taught of God to love the Brethren, and by this all must know that we are Christs Disciples; and <hi>he that loveth not his brother abideth in death.</hi> There is a holy disposition to Unity and closure in all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. And if you have not this disposition your selves, you are but hypocrites: if you have it, how dare you sinne against it? Though you must not unite with any in their sinne, you must unite with all that are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians in their Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>

                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:170535:72"/> 7. Moreover, <hi>Your course is contrary to Christian humility, and proclaimeth the most abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Pride of the dividers.</hi> That you should call all the rest of the Christian world, <hi>Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks and Hereticks,</hi> and say, that none are Christians but you? Why, what are you above other men, that you should say, <hi>[Come not near me, I am holier than thou?]</hi> Have none in the world think you, faith, and hope, and charity, but you? Can you indeed believe that none shall be saved, but you? Alas that you should not only so much overlook Gods graces in your brethren, but also be so insensible of your own infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties! Have you so many errours and sinnes among you, and yet are <hi>none</hi> of the Church, but <hi>you?</hi> Me thinks an humble soul should say, <hi>Alas, I am so bad, that I</hi>
                     <pb n="130" facs="tcp:170535:73"/>
                     <hi>am liker to be cast out than they; I am unworthy of the Communion of the Saints!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>Yea you trespasse against common reason it self.</hi> Do you think it <hi>Reasonable</hi> for us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that all those that we see walk uprightly with God and men, earnest in prayer, and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to know the truth, holy and humble and heavenly Christians, are yet out of the Church, and state of life, because they be not rebaptized with the <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists,</hi> or because they believe not in the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> with the Papists? It's hard to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that he that pretends to believe such unreasonable things as these, doth well believe Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity it self.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. <hi>And how could you honour and gratifie the Devil more, and magnifie his Kingdome, then by teaching men that most of the</hi>

What dealing is this for a Christian to be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of?</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Lastly, <hi>Consider what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable Doctrine it is that you deliver, especially to your selves?</hi> You will not <hi>believe</hi> that all these Sects and differing parties that hold the essentials are members of the Catholick Church: You scorn at such a Church, and say, what a med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley Church is this? Will Christ entertain men of so many opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and of so much corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Yea, or else woe to you,

                  <p>Consider now of these Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations of your sinne: To think and say, 1. That <hi>one piece of the Church</hi> is the <hi>whole Church.</hi> 2. Yea, and a <hi>piece</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Answ. <hi>Of OƲR CHƲRCH?</hi> Why Sirs? Do you think we have a <hi>Catholick Church</hi> by our selves? Is there any more Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Churches then One? Do you not know, where the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church</hi> was <hi>before Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and in all ages? Why <hi>there</hi> was <hi>our Church,</hi> for we have no other, we know but one. Do you not know where there were <hi>any Christians before Luther,</hi> or in all ages?

                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:170535:75"/> there was our Church: Would you have the world believe that there were no Christians but the Subjects of the Pope? <hi>Can</hi> you believe it your selves? Doth not your <hi>Canus</hi> confess, as before cited, that most of the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and Bishops of the whole world were against the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and had the Arms of Emperors on their sides? Doth not your <hi>Reinerius</hi> long ago say (or who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was the Authour of that conclusion. <hi>Contr. Waldens. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. in Biblioth. Patr. T.</hi> 4. <hi>pag.</hi> 773.) <hi>[The Churches of the Armenians, Ethiopians and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, and the rest which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles converted, are not under the Church of Rome.]</hi> What fuller confessions can we desire? Nay do we not know how small a part of the world did believe your <hi>Ʋniversal Sovereignty</hi> till

               </p>
               <p>But you must have us tell you, <hi>Where was a Church that had all our opinions?</hi> To which I answer, 1. When you have shewed us a <hi>Catholick Church</hi> that held <hi>all your opinions,</hi> we shall quickly tell you of one that held <hi>ours.</hi> 2. It is not <hi>all our opinions</hi> that are <hi>essential</hi> to a Christian, and the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> It is <hi>Christianity</hi> that makes us Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians and members of the Church: It is not every inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our truth. That which makes us <hi>Christians</hi> and <hi>Catholicks,</hi> all true <hi>Christians</hi> in the world have as well as we: and therefore we are of the same Catholick Church. <hi>Aethiopians, Syrians,</hi>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:170535:76"/>
                  <hi>Armenians, Egyptians, Georgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Jacobites,</hi> the many Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Greeks, Muscovites,</hi> and <hi>Russians;</hi> and all other that are against the <hi>Romane</hi> Sovereignty, are of the same Religion and <hi>Catholick Church</hi> as we: And so are all among your selves too, that are Christians indeed. The points which we <hi>agree in</hi> make us <hi>all Christians,</hi> and <hi>Church-members:</hi> but the points in which we <hi>differ</hi> from the <hi>Papists,</hi> do make us so much <hi>sounder</hi> and <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer</hi> Christians than these, that I would not be one of them for all the world. A sound man is but a man; and so is a man that hath the plague: But yet there is some difference, though not in their manhood.</p>
               <p>If therefore you will at any time try whether your Doctrins or ours be the <hi>sounder,</hi> we are heartily willing to appeal to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity!
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:170535:77"/> Spit in his face, and spare not, that will not stand to this motion: <hi>That the eldest way of Religion shall carry it: and they that are of latest beginning shall be judged to be in the wrong.</hi> I abhorre that Religion that is less then sixteen hundred years of age; and therefore I cannot be a Papist. I confess in the streams of after-ages, there have been divisions in the <hi>Integrals</hi> of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, or the points that tend to the <hi>soundnesse</hi> of the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. And in this, I say, <hi>Let the eldest be held the best.</hi> But for the <hi>Essentials</hi> of Christianity, and the Church there never was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision among true Christians: for they could <hi>not be Christians</hi> that wanted any <hi>Essential</hi> part. And therefore <hi>that One Church which contained all the Christians in the world, was our Church before Luther;</hi> and the Catalogues of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:170535:77"/> the Professours are our Church rolls: But we count by <hi>thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands,</hi> and by <hi>Countreys,</hi> and not by names.</p>
               <p>But perhaps you'l say, <hi>You cannot be of the same Church with the Greeks, or us, or the other parties, that you name: for we and they do all renounce you.</hi> I answer, As if it were in your power, who shall be no mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Christ and his Church, by your <hi>renouncing</hi> him! Your <hi>renouncing</hi> may prove you no <hi>Christians your selves</hi> perhaps, by proving you <hi>(in some cases)</hi> uncharitable: but it can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to unchurch or unchristen others. If I should say <hi>my self, [I am no member of the Church]</hi> that doth not make me none, as long as I am a Christian: much lesse can <hi>your</hi> saying so. Saith <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 15, 16. <hi>[If the foot shall say, Because I am not the</hi>

And if the ear shall say, because I am not the eye, I am not of the body, Is it therefore not of the body?]</hi> The words of a mans mouth make not another to be what he is not, or cease to be what he is. Every one is not a bastard, or a whore, that another in rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing passion calleth so.

               <p>And now, Beloved Hearers, you have been acquainted from the word of God, of the Nature and Unity of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> I beseech you resolve to retain this Doctrine, and make use of it for your selves and others.

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:170535:81"/> they think that the Papists are the true Church.</p>
               <p>But consider before you run past your understandings of these two things: First, <hi>there is no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Concord to be expected upon earth: This is the glory that's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the life to come.</hi> You might easily see this, if you were but considerate.

One thinks <hi>this</hi> is the right, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinks <hi>that</hi> is the right: And if we had all so much knowledge, as to resolve all these doubts, do you think we should not be sooner agreed?

                  </gap> among us, as would shew us <hi>all the truth,</hi> it would soon make us friends. But this is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in this Life. Even <hi>Paul</hi> faith, that here we know but in part; we understand as Children, and think and speak as Children; and is it any wonder to have Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren fall out? <hi>But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part, shall be done away: Now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now we know in part; but then we shall know even as we are known.</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 9, 10, 11, 12. And therefore we find even <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; <hi>Barnabas</hi> so farre disagreed as to part asunder, because they had not both so much knowledge, as to know whether <hi>Marke</hi> should be taken with them or not. In Heaven onely we shall know perfectly: and therefore in Heaven onely we shall be united, and agree perfectly.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:170535:82"/> 2. And we can never be perfect in Union and agreement among our selves, till we are perfect in union and agreement with Christ. For we cannot regularly be neerer to each other then we are to our Center: For it is the Center only in which we must unite. It is not possible to be neerlyer united a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our selves by a Christian union, then we are to Christ: And therefore seeing it is only in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that we are <hi>perfectly united</hi> to Christ, and at agreement with him, it is only in Heaven that we must be perfectly united among our selves. You marvail that we so much differ from one another. But you forget how much we all differ yet from Jesus Christ; and that this is the difference that must be first made up, before we do any good of the rest.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Moreover, we can never be <hi>perfectly united and agreed,</hi> till
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:170535:83"/> we are <hi>perfectly Holy,</hi> and every grace be perfect in us: For Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness is that new Nature in which we must be one: And every grace hath a hand in our accord: When we are perfect in love, and perfect in humility, and meekness, and patience; and perfect in self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyall, and all other graces, then and never till then, shall we be perfect in our union and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment among our selves: while there is the least sin in the soul, it will hinder our full agreement with God and men: It is sin that woundeth both the soul and the Church, and makes all the bate and divisions among us: And when all sin is gone, then all diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences will be done, and never till then. What an ignorant thing then is it of you, to wonder so much at our many differences, and yet not to wonder at our sinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and unholiness, and difference
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:170535:83"/> with Christ in whom we must a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. Well, remember hereafter, that Unity and Concord is here to be expected, but according to the proportion of our Holiness, and therefore so much sin and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance as remains, no wonder if so much division remain.</p>
               <p>The second thing which I desire you to remember is this: <hi>that in all the Essentiall matters of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, there is as true a vanity among all the differing sorts of Christians, as there is among the Papists, or any one sect:</hi> Even in all the twenty points of Union, which I named in the beginning. And this is the Union that is most to be esteemed, or at least, this is enough to make us of One Christ. As the great essentiall points of faith are of far greater moment and excellency, then our several controverted by-opinions, so is a Union in these great essentiall
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:170535:84"/> points, more excellent then an Union in smaller matters: Though both together is best of all, if joyned with the truth.</p>
               <p>To these let me add also a third consideration, that it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to find the Papists as a <hi>sect</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed among themselves. For so are <hi>other sects,</hi> as well as they: yea let me add more, that <hi>I know not of any one sect in the world, that differ so much among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as the Papists do.</hi> The <hi>Greeks</hi> are kept from so much difference by their want of learning, which keeps them from medling so much with niceties, and running into so many controversies as the Papists do. The like may be said of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopians, Armenians,</hi> and many more. The Protestants differ not in half, nor a quarter so many points as the Papists do: Nay the very Anabaptists themselves do not differ among themselves in
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:170535:84"/> the tenth part so many points as the Papists. If the many hundred differences among their Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators, Schoolmen, Casuists and other writers, were collected and presented to your view, I much doubt whether there be any one sect on the face of the earth, that hath the twenti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h part so many differences among themselves as the Papists have. Though they think they salve all by saying that they differ not in Articles of faith, yet their differences are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the fewer for that. And others may say more in that than they can do.</p>
               <p>Well! remember this advice: expect not a heavenly perfection of Unity and Concord, till you come to Heaven.</p>

               <p n="3">3.

               <p n="4">4. A Peaceable spirit, must be in some measure meek and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, with a humble consciousnes of its own frailties and offences: But alas, what passionate, rash and turbulent spirits do abound in the poor divided Church? such as are made of Gunpowder, and speak fire and sword; that will do no right, nor bear no wrong; that will speak well of few but

But the miserable world will not discern or take up with this. The Papists are of two Churches (for they have two Heads or Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns, which specifie the society.) One of the Popish Churches, make the Pope the Head and Center, and all the Church must unite in him, or it can be no Church!

As Divine faith will have no formall Object but Divine veracity, so neither can Christian unity have any universall proper Center but Christ. As at the building of <hi>Babel,</hi> when men would unite for their future security in their own devices, it brought them to utter confusion, which the world groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth under to this day: so when men will build a <hi>Babel</hi> of their own invention, for the preventing of the inundation of heresies, they are upon the most dreadful work of confusion. The Church is taught by the Scripture, and the Holy Ghost within them, to take up no where short of God, to call no man on earth, the Father or Master of our faith, not to trust in man, and make flesh our arm.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:170535:90"/> Man is too dark and too weak a Creature, to be the Head or Center of the Church: deluded Papists! you think you befriend the Churches unity, when you hang it by a hair, and build it on the sand, and found it on meer weakness: could you prove that ever God had promised abilities and gifts to the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> proportionable to such a work, we should most gladly look out to him for the exercise of those abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.

The <hi>Law</hi> is sufficient to its own part, which is to be the <hi>Rule of duty, and</hi>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:170535:92"/>
                  <hi>of judgement.</hi> It tells men suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, what they must believe and do; but if they will not do it, it judgeth them as offendors. Youl'e never form a Confession, or make a Law that cannot be misinterpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and broken. The Papists have set up whole volums of Councils and Decrees, for the <hi>Rule,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth because the Scripture is dark, and all Hereticks plead Scripture. And what have they done by it, but cause more darkness, and set the world and their own Doctors too, in greater contentions, so that now Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils crosse Councils, and they can neither agree which be true ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Councils, and which not; nor when they intend a Decree to be an Article of faith, and when not; no nor what sense to take their words in, and how to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile them. And thus men lose themselves, and abuse the Church,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:170535:92"/> because Gods word will not serve their turn as a Rule, for us to unite upon. This is the <hi>One Rule</hi> that God hath left, and men will needs blame this as insufficient, and mend Gods works by the devices of their addle brains, and then complain of divisions, when they have made them! One Company of Bishops must needs make a company of Cannon Laws for the Church, and all must be Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, that will not be ruled by them: Another Company that are of another mind, make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Canons, and those must be obeyed, or else we are Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks. They must make us our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and call them Homelies, and make us our Prayers, and call them a Leiturgie: and the fruit of their brains must be the Rule of all others, or else they are Schismaticks. So wise and holy are they, above all their brethren,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:170535:93"/> that none must publickly speak to God, in any words but what they put into their mouths. (Read Dr. <hi>Heylins</hi> Discourse of <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 5. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Ministers, praying in the Church in any other words but what is in the common Prayer-Book.) So they do also by their Vestures and Gestures, and other ceremonies: Nothing hath more divided the Church, then the proud impositions of men, that think so highly of their own words and forms, and ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous devices, that no man shall have communion with Christ and the Church, in any other way. Never will the Church unite on such termes. The Rule that all must agree in, must be made by <hi>One</hi> that is above <hi>all,</hi> and whose authority is acknowledged by all. Experience might tell these men, that they are building but a <hi>Babel,</hi> and dividing the Church.
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:170535:93"/> In the Lords Supper, where they have limited us to a Gesture, we are all in pieces. In singing Psalms where they left us free, we have no discension. In the places where Garments and other Ceremonies are not imposed, Gods worship is performed without contention, and with as little uncomeliness as with them.) Proud quarrelsom men, that must needs be Lording it over the Church, and turning Legislators, may set all on fire for the promoting of their wayes, and rail at all that will not be under their yoak: but when they have all done, they will find, they are but busily dividing the Church, and their Canons are but fiery Engines to batter its unty and peace. A thousand years experience and more, might have taught us this to our cost. Never will the Church have full unity, till the Scripture suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:170535:94"/> be more generally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged. You complain of <hi>many opinions and wayes,</hi> and <hi>many</hi> you will still have, till the <hi>One Rule,</hi> the Scripture, be the Standard of our Religion. As men that divide and seperate from us, do use to <hi>accuse the Ministers,</hi> and then be every man a Teacher to himself; so they use to <hi>accuse the Scriptures,</hi> and (as the Papists) call them dark, and dangerous, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient: and then every sect must make us a new Rule, when they have disparaged that which Christ hath given us. Then one makes the Pope a Rule by his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretals, and another a Council, and another the Bishops Canons, or Articles, and another his own suggestions and impulses. Stick close to this One Bible, and let nothing come into your faith or Religion, but what comes
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:170535:94"/> thence, and when Controversies arise, try them by this; and if you cannot do it your selves, then take the help of Ministers or Synods, and use them not as Masters, but as helpers of your faith; not to make you <hi>another Rule,</hi> but to help you to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand this <hi>Onely Rule,</hi> and thus you may come to be of <hi>one Religion,</hi> but never other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>

All in the Scripture is true and usefull but all is not essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall to Christianity.

Yea some are drawn from the Churches Unity and Peace, <hi>by misunderstanding those Texts of Scripture that call for separation from the world, and that speak of the fewness of those that shall be saved.</hi> I have heard of one that turned separatist upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, because he thought, that seeing the Flock of Christ is little, the Protestants were too many to be it: At last, the separated Church grew so big, that he thought, sure this is not the little Flock, and so turned to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptists: At last, the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists Church so increased, that he thought, sure this is too big to be the little Flock; and so went seeking about for the least, as thinking that must needs be in the right. Alas, what low thoughts have such of the Church of God? yea, &amp; of the Love &amp; gracious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:170535:110"/> of God, &amp; of the great design of Christ, in the work of Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption? But the main Cause of the delusion of these poor souls is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they know not the state of the world abroad. If they did but know that it is the sixth part of the world that are baptized common Christians, and not past a sixth or seventh part of that sixth part, that are common Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, but all the rest are Papists, and Greeks, and many sorts of more ignorant unreformed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians; and among the Protestants, no Countrey for godliness is like to <hi>England;</hi> they would not go about to pen up the Church into a narrower room. To believe that Christ died, and made so much adoe for so small a part of the world, as comes not to one of forty, or fifty, or an hundred-thousand, is next to flat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity it self; which thinks

               <p>And for the Command, <hi>[Come out from among them, and be ye separate,]</hi> its pitty that any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian should need to be told, that it speaks onely to the Church to come out of the Heathen, Infidel world (such as are Jews and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans, and Heathens;) but there is never a word in all the Bible, that bids you <hi>[Come out of the Church and be ye seperate!]</hi> wonderfull! that God should be so abused by misunderstanding Christians! Because he commands men to come out of the Infidel world into the Church, they plead it, as if he commanded them to come out of the Church into a separated sect. The Church is the House of Christ: Forsake it not, while <hi>he</hi> stayes in it: For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake it not, for <hi>he</hi> hath promised never to forsake it.

And hence it is, that such men are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes on the stronger side, and of the Kings Religion; or else are seeking carnall advantages to carry on their Cause. So the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites are more busie to get the Princes of the world engaged for them, and the Arms of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:170535:111"/> employed for their ends, then we are to treat of Unity and Peace: And every party, instead of seeking Peace, is seeking to get highest, that they may be able to force all others to their will: And we can never get any Peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble debates upen equal termes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the several parties do sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <hi>stand</hi> on equal termes: But still one is up and another is down: and he that is in the saddle, will not light to treat of Peace, nor hearken to any equall moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but must have his will, and nothing less will serve the turn: And when he is down, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther party is up, the case is the same.

Lastly, The greatest hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance of our Unity is, <hi>the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godliness of the most that profess themselves Christians, whereby they become uncapable matter for our truest neerest Ʋnion,</hi> and yet think that we must be united to them all: when they will not joyn with us in the vitalls of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but stick in the bark, and take up with the name, yet do they think that we must joyn with them, and be of their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and opinions in all externall things, and if we differ from them, they think we are Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks. Men lay the Churches U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity too much in meer speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which they call the Articles of faith, and too little in Practicals, and holiness of life, whereas there is no Article of faith, but is for practice; and as truly as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:170535:113"/> and will are both es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentiall to the soul, so truly the sanctity of understanding and will are both essentiall to a Christian: And as the Holiness of the Heart, is as essentiall as faith to a Reall Christian, or member of the Church regenerate; so the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Holiness is as essentiall as the Profession of faith, to make a man a member of the Church, visible or Congregate. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as we can have no inward Union and Communion, with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but the truly sanctified, so can we have no visible Church-Union or Communion, but with those that <hi>Profess</hi> to be truly sanctified. Its a shameful thing to hear every drunkard and scorner at godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, to rail at the many divisions in the Church, and to call for U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Concord, when its he, and such as he that hinder it, that will not be united to Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:170535:114"/> nor joyn with us in the onely Center of Union, nor in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test and most necessary things, without which all Christian Union is impossible.

               <p>To conclude all, let me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort all Christians, to drink in this Truth into their Judgements and affections. If you are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians indeed, you are Catholicks. And if so, you must have 1. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick <hi>Principles,</hi> And 2. <hi>Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> I beseech you look to both these well.</p>
               <p>And as you must keep the great Catholick Principle, which is the subject of our discourse, <hi>viz.</hi> To know what a true Catholick is, and which is the Catholick Church, that so you may not do
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:170535:114"/> as the Papists, that take up a sect under the abused name of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licisme, and plead against the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church for that sect, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of the Catholick Church; so also you must know, and keep close to the true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick <hi>Rule;</hi> and not do as the Papists that have honoured a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and crooked Rule by that name, to the Churches trouble, and their own delusion: And also you must keep close to the true Catholick Governour of the Church and judge of Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, and turn not aside with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists and others, to an usurper, or a private judge. In these three, your Catholicisme must much consist. The first, (what the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church is, and what a true Catholick) I have said as much to as I conceive necessary. The other two I shall say a little more to, viz. <hi>The Catholick Rule,</hi>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:170535:115"/> and the <hi>Catholick Judge,</hi> and then of the 4th and last, which is, the <hi>Catholick spirit or Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. We are all agreed, that the <hi>Will of God revealed,</hi> must be, and is <hi>the Catholick Rule of faith and life.</hi> But we are not all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, <hi>which is this Revelation of the Will of God.</hi> That the Book of the Creatures and the principles of Nature, do reveal much naturall-morall verity and duty, we are agreed: but the doubt is of <hi>supernaturall Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And of this we are agreed, that [whatsoever is certainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the Church by Prophet or Apostle, or any person infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly proving a Divine inspiration or Command, to deliver what he speaks, must be received as from God. And whatever is so revealed concerning faith or du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by way of imposition, is our
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:170535:115"/> Rule: and if revealed to All, it is the Rule to all:] We are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed also, that the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures containing those Books which the Reformed Churches take for the Cannon, are a Divine infallible Revelation concerning Faith and Duty. And therefore we are all agreed, that the <hi>Holy Scriptures are the Rule.</hi> But whether they be the <hi>whole Rule,</hi> we are not agreed. The Reformed Churches say, that the <hi>sign</hi> is but to make known the <hi>Doctrine sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified:</hi> and that while the inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Apostles were themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, their own voices were the <hi>sign,</hi> and instead of a written word to all that heard them and more. But knowing that they must die, and that the word of persons not infallibly inspired, is no Rule of faith, and how hardly things not written, are preserved from alteration and deprivation, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:170535:116"/> they left their Doctrine in writing, for the easier and surer, and more universall Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and preservation. And that Universall infallible Tradition hath delivered us down both this Scripture, and also (by it selfe) the sum of Christianity, in the Creed and Baptismall Covenant, and in the hearts of the faithfull from age to age. So that we make very high account of Tradition, as bringing us in one hand, the essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials of Christianity, and in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the whole body of sacred Doctrine in the Scriptures, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining all these Essentials and more, And this is the Rule of our faith and life: yet we confess, that if any <hi>could prove,</hi> a <hi>certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery</hi> of any more from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles to the Church, we are ready to receive it, which way ever it be delivered. But the Papists adde, that partly Tradition, and partly
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:170535:116"/> the Cannons and Decrees of the Church, are to be received as the Rule as well as Scripture, and that much is revealed by verball Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that end, which is not in Scripture, which is with equall pious affection and reverence to be received; and that the Church which is the keeper of this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, is onely the Roman Church, or all that believe in the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall Head or Soveraign of the Church.</p>
               <p>Now the Question is, <hi>Whether theirs or ours be the Catholick Rule?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here the wickedness of factious Disputers, hath done the Church a world of wrong on both sides. Some are so mad in their Contentions, that they care not what they say scarce, so they do but cry down one another. The Papists cannot cry up their Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:170535:117"/> but they must speak so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfully, impiously, foolishly, of the Scriptures, as if they were stark Infidels. To omit others, the reading of <hi>Rushworths</hi> Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues, and <hi>Whites</hi> additions and Defence, is a notable bait to tice men to Infidelity, and those Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues contain the very same Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments which the new Apostate Infidels use. And on the other side, many to say as much as they can against the Papists, do so cry down Traditions, that they <hi>(tantum non)</hi> disable themselves to make good the Scripture it self. O perversness! O dolefull fruits of Contentions! Whereas a true Catholick should be glad of any light from Heaven, whatsoever: and must know, that God in great mercy to his Church, hath by these two hands, delivered us his will: Not <hi>some part in Scripture,</hi> and <hi>the rest by unwritten Traditions,</hi>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:170535:117"/> as say the Papists: but <hi>some part by such Tradition, and all by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi> and <hi>that Scripture by Tradition.</hi> So that God hath given us two strings to one bow: and the Papists will have two bowes also; and others will have but one string.</p>
               <p>Well; 1. I prove that the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is the Catholick Rule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is the Catholick Rule of faith, which the whole Church in all ages and places hath received as the Rule: but such is the Scripture. <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Protestants, Greeks</hi> and <hi>Armenians, Abassines</hi> and all <hi>Christians,</hi> confess that the Canonicall Scriptures, are the Revelation of the Will of God: so that this must be Catholick, which the Catholick Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And I prove, that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists Rule is a Sectarian crooked Rule, and not Catholick. 1. That
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:170535:118"/> is not the Catholick Rule of faith, which the Catholick Church did never receive: but such is the Popish Rule of Roman Tradition: therefore if you take it in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, <hi>viz. [The Traditions of the Roman Church to be received by her peculiar authority.]</hi> 1. The Reformed Churches now disown it. 2. The <hi>Greeks</hi> and other <hi>Eastern</hi> and <hi>Southern</hi> Churches now dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own it. 3. The primitive Church did never own it: so that all the Church was once a stranger to their Rule, and the most of it is an adversary to it at this day. And can that be the Catholick Rule, which most of the Catholick Church disclaims? The <hi>Eastern</hi> and <hi>Southern</hi> Churches think that the <hi>Roman</hi> Traditions are of no more authority then their own: nay of farre lesse, and much of them false. 2. If you look to their additions of the Apocryphall
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:170535:118"/> Books, to the Cannon of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, the ancient Catholick Church was against them; as Dr. <hi>Reignolds,</hi> and newly Dr. <hi>Cosin</hi> at large, and through every age hath shewed. 3. If you come to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars: The very Essence of the Roman Catholicism and Church, and the Universall Head still of their Pope, which are the master points of their Tradition, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed and detested by the far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the Catholick Church on earth, to this day. And is this a Catholick Rule which the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church denyeth? A great stir the Papists make about <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Tradition,</hi> and the <hi>Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Catholick Church.</hi> But what good would this do them, if we were as much for Tradition as they? When the <hi>most of the Catholick Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth them</hi> and <hi>their Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> or own them not, even in
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:170535:119"/> the principall points essentiall to their Religion?</p>
               <p>And what have they to say to this? Nothing but what any thief may say of a true man when he hath cut his purse, even to call him thief first! Forsooth, <hi>most that are called Christians, by far, are all Hereticks; and therefore none of the Catholick Church; and therefore their votes are no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment to the Papall claim.</hi> And how prove you that? <hi>Why the Pope saith so, and so do his faction.</hi> Why but he is a party! how know we that he saith true? Why here you must leave them: <hi>he saith that he saith true; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he saith true: He saith that the most of the Church, are not of the Church, but Hereticks, and that none but his subjects are of the Church, therefore it is true.</hi> And so he must be the judge in his own Cause, and be believed by the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:170535:119"/> Catholick Church on his own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. Read but the third Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Rushworth's</hi> second Heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Dialogues, and see what a filly shift the self-conceited Disputant is at, in answering this Objection, <hi>[All Christians agree in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of the Scripture, and far fewer in divers points of Doctrine? for the Churches of the Roman Communion, are no such extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary part of Christendom, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to all the rest.</hi> Answ. <hi>For the extent of the Churches, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not certainly tell you the truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I fear many are called Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stains, who have little either in their belief or lives, to verifie that name: But you know, in Witnesses, the quality is to be respected, as well, and more then the quantity: so that these Countries, in which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity is vigerous, are to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before a greater extent of such, where little remains more then the</hi>

And if the Pope can cure Heresie or Infidelity, why doth he suffer most of the world to be Infidels, and most of profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Christians to be (in his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) Hereticks? And if he can decide all Controversies, why suffers he so many hundred to be undecided, among his followers.

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:170535:121"/> that neither he nor his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects know when he hath decided a Controversie, and when not.

The Catholick Judge doth not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the Catholick Rule; but the Pope and his Council doth. 3. The Catholick Judge contradicteth not himself, but so do Popes and Councils. 4. That is not the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Judge, whom most of the Catholick Church disowneth, and never did own: but most of them never owned the Pope.

                  <p>Answ. The Case is plain, if men were but impartiall. <hi>Discerning</hi> is one thing, <hi>Teaching</hi> is another, and <hi>Deciding</hi> or <hi>Determining</hi> is another.

<pb n="229" facs="tcp:170535:122"/> error, and better inform him: and thus far Judicial Decisive power is unnecessary: But if he will not be convinced, but <hi>still deny</hi> the Articles of the faith, then comes in the <hi>judicial Decisive</hi> Power in <hi>order to his punishment.</hi> The Articles of faith are to be <hi>discerned, and judged by,</hi> but not <hi>judged</hi> themselves, any otherwise then to be <hi>Taught:</hi> But it is the <hi>Heretick</hi> or <hi>offender</hi> that is to be <hi>judged.</hi> And the <hi>judgement</hi> being in order to <hi>execution,</hi> there is a twofold Judgement, as there is a twofold execution. 1. If the Question be, <hi>Who shall be taken for a Heretick, in order to the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall punishment or forcible coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of him by the sword,</hi> here the Magistrate onely is the Judge: And it is 1. A vile usurpation in the Pope, to take this power out of his hands; 2. And it is an intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable abuse of Magistrates! It
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:170535:123"/> makes them but like hang-men, or meer executioners; when the Pope and his Clergy must be the Judges of Heresies, and the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate must but execute their Judgement? What if the Church or Pope, judge a Catholick to be a Heretick, must the Magistrate therefore burn an innocent mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Christ? They confess them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that the Pope may erre in matter of fact, and judge a man to be a Heretick that is none: And if <hi>he</hi> could not erre, yet sure his <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie</hi> may: Yea they confess a <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Council may,</hi> and say, they <hi>did erre</hi> in condemning Pope <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius</hi> of Heresie. And must Kings and Judges, and all Magistrates, hang and burn all innocent people that the Popish Clergy shall falsly judge Hereticks: Will it justifie them before God, to say, <hi>The Pope or Bishops bid us burn them?</hi> No, I had rather be a Dog, then be a
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:170535:123"/> King upon these conditions. 3. And indeed it is <hi>impossible</hi> for the Pope <hi>himself</hi> to be Judge of all men through the world that are guilty of Heresie. For he is many hundred, or thousand miles off: and there must be a <hi>present</hi> Judge that shall hear the Cause and Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses; and there must be many thousand of these Judges to the whole world: and can the Pope or Council then serve alone?

<pb n="232" facs="tcp:170535:124"/> us all the Essential Articles in Creeds, Professions, and the Baptismall Covenant! And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here is no work for a Judge, but for a Teacher. The Pastors of the Church must teach us <hi>ex officio,</hi> with authority, which are the Articles of saith; but they have no Power to judge an Article to be no Article, nor to make any new Article: And to judge an Article to be an Article, <hi>any man</hi> may do, by judgement of <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning,</hi> and <hi>any Teachers</hi> by a Judgement of <hi>Direction.</hi> If more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, you would have no Article of faith believed to be such, but on the word or Credit of the Pope or Council, and so resolve our faith into them, I have fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed this in my third Dispute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Popery! The word of God must be believed, whether men know the mind of the Pope and Council or not? But this is the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:170535:124"/> highest arrogancy of the Papall sect, that they must not have Gods own Lawes believed, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by any, but upon their word and credit? And so we must know, that they are authorized hereto, and infallible, before we know the Articles of our faith; and so we must believe in <hi>Christs</hi> Vicar, before we can believe in <hi>Christ?</hi> This is the ground of the Papall cause. Well, I think I may take it for granted by this time, that with reasonable impartial considerate men, the case is plain; that it is Magistrates, and not the Pope that are Judges, <hi>Who is to be corporally punished for He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie!</hi> And if every Bishop must do it, then 1. they must prove <hi>every Bishop</hi> infallible; and 2. then they have not <hi>one</hi> Catholick Judge of faith, but many.</p>
                  <p>And what if we had granted them a power in the Pope or
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:170535:125"/> Council, to judge of Gods Law, and what is an Article of faith, and what is heresie? yet this will be far from restraining heresies, as long as there is no Judge of the particular Case: and if we have as many Judges of the Cause and Person as there be Bishops, then we have not <hi>one</hi> Catholick Judge of Persons and Causes; and if we must have fallible Bishops (yea and Popes) to judge of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and fact, then we have but fallible restrainers of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie.</p>

E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that Church that must avoid, or reject them from Communion. And therefore as Communion is
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:170535:125"/> of narrower or wider extension, so must excommunication, and judging of Hereticks be. If the Question be onely, <hi>Whether this man be to be avoided as a Heretick by this particular Church where he liveth?</hi> that Church must judge? If the Question be, <hi>Whether he be to be avoided as a Heretick by all the Churches of the Countrey or Nation,</hi> it is all these Churches that must judge? For who should judge, but those that must practice and answer for their Practice? And how can the Pope or Council be able to judge Persons and Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses that they know not; and to judge so many millions through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the world? If you could prove that the whole Catholick Church were bound to take notice of this individuall Heretick, and were capable of actuall Communion, and avoiding Communion with him, and of congregating to
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:170535:126"/> judge him, then I should consent that all Christendom should meet to excommunicate a Heretick, if they had no better work the while to do. But the Case is plain, that the Church that must execute, must judge: the Church that must avoid the Communion of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick, must judge him to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided: And I think the Pope and Generall Councils, will not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take all this work.</p>
                  <p>You have nothing therefore to say, but to recur to the former way in your Objection, viz. <hi>That it is the work of Pope and Generall Councils, to judge what is faith and Heresies, and the work of Provinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Synods or Bishops, to judge the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendors by their Cannons.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> That is plainly; the Pope and Council must <hi>make the Law,</hi> and the Bishops <hi>judge by</hi> it. But 1. God hath made the Churches Law already: we know
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:170535:126"/> but this one Lawgiver to the Church, to constitute Articles of faith and spirituall duty. And is this all, that you make such a noise about, when you say, <hi>[Who shall be judge of faith and Heresie, and Controversie?]</hi> that is, <hi>Who shall make Lawes against them, to tell us, which is faith and which is Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie?</hi> Why God hath done this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in the Scripture. 2. And this will not answer your own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations in resolving your doubt? For if the Popes <hi>Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> be all his judging of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies, there will be never the fewer Controversies or Heresies in the world: For there's no Law that hath a vertue sufficient to compel all the subjects <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. If there be any abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Judge of the sense of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, this work is to give the world a decisive Commentary upon it: which no Pope or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill hath done? 2. And he should actually decide all the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies a foot, which the Pope dare not attempt; but leaves hundreds un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decided among themselves, and more then ever were among the Protestants. 3. Its the work of a Teacher, and not a Catholick Judge, to acquaint men with the meaning of the Law. 4. For all their malignant accusation of the Scriptures, they do as plainly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us the Articles of Christian faith, and the necessary Christian duties, as any Pope or Council hath done. And if all the work for a Pope or Council, be to teach
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:170535:127"/> God how to speak, or mend his word, and make sense of it, when God hath made it but non-sence, (in their presumptuous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) then we can well spare such a Judge as this. 5. There's as much contention among your selves, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the meaning of the Cannons of Councils, and the Popes Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals: and who must be Judge of all these Controversies? Even the late Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> is pleaded by one party for one side, and by another for the contrary: yea, even by the particular Divines that were members of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill. And yet no deciding Judge steps up; but let the contenders worry one another, and there is no end of their Disputes.</p>
                  <p>So that the case is as plain as can be desired, 1. That <hi>constituting by a Law or Ʋniversal Rule, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine what shall be taken for faith, and what for Heresie,</hi> this
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:170535:128"/>
                     <hi>God</hi> hath done, who is the onely Universal Lawgiver, and we need no Pope for it. 2. <hi>To judge who is to be corporally punished as a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick,</hi> belongs to the <hi>Magistrate</hi> in his own Jurisdiction, and not to Pope or Bishops: (As hath been made good in all ages against them, since they claimed it, as the many Tractates of <hi>Goldastus</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection manifest.) 3. <hi>To judge who shall be cast out of the Communion of the Church as a Heretick, and avoided,</hi> belongs to <hi>the Church that hath Communion with him,</hi> and that is to avoid him; and to all other Churches, so far as they are naturally capable of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and non-Communion with him, and of the cognizance of the case, and bound to take notice of it. So that all humane Judgement is but limited and <hi>ad hoc▪</hi> the Judgment being but in order to the execution. 4. And therefore
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:170535:128"/> the <hi>Absolute finall Judgement</hi> is onely that of <hi>Christ himself,</hi> to whom we must make our appeales, and from whom there is no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal: And this is the true decision of this Question, that makes so lowd a noise, <hi>Who shall be judge of Controversies in faith, and of Heresies.</hi> And thus you see, that <hi>Scripture is the Catholick Rule, and Christ the Catholick Judge, and the Magistrate the Judge</hi> ad hoc, <hi>who shall be corporally pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ished,</hi> and <hi>the Pastors and Church where Communion or Avoiding the party is a duty, are Judges,</hi> ad hoc, <hi>Whether he be to be avoided.</hi> And this is the next Catholick Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</p>

                  <hi>Licence</hi> (upon exploration and approbation) to practise Physick when they are called, and afterward, may have a <hi>speciall Call</hi> and engagement to a particular Hospitall or City, as their charge, and so do practise occasionally upon a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular call abroad, but ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily at home, as to their speciall charge, but to both as Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians; so is it with a Pastor in the Church of Christ.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is a private and unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Principle, that a Minister is so bound to that one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation which is his speciall Charge, as that he must prefer them and their service, before the more publick service of the Churches, and must neglect op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of doing apparently much greater good, for fear of neglecting them. All our obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations are strongest to our ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:170535:130"/> end, and next to that which is next that end, and so more to the Publick then to any particulars as such.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And it is a private unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Principle, that a Minister should more fear or avoid the offending or hurting of his own particular flock, then the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and hurt of the Catholick Church, or of many particular Churches where the Interest of Christ and the Gospel is greater, we are more obliged to God, and the Catholick Church, then we can be to any man or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church. A Physician of an Hospitall <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> must prefer his own charge before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, and rather neglect a strangers life then theirs: But he should rather neglect one of his own charge, then a Prince, or many considerable persons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, or all his own charge,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:170535:130"/> then persons, or Cities, or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of far more publick use and interest.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is a private uncatholick principle, that Ministers may sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie their Consciences, if they stay at home, and onely look after their own Congregations, and never go to the Assemblies of the Ministers, where more publick affaires of the Churches are transacted, nor by preaching abroad where necessity requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it, be helpfull to other places.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And it is an uncatholick Principle, to hold that the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies and Associations of Pastors and concatenation of Churches by them, is a needless thing; or that they are not to be ordinary, and fixed, for a certain setled way of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Churches and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, but onely occasionall and
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:170535:131"/> seldom, and that it is indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent whether we be there.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And it is an uncatholick dividing Principle to hold, that when the Churches agree upon a Circumstance of worship as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, any particular persons shall walk singularly, and refuse to consent to that agreement, unless it be against the word of God.</p>
               <p n="8">8. It is not according to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Principles, for any man of another Church, to make light of the reproofs, advice or teaching, of any faithfull Minister of Christ, because they are not members of his charge.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Nor is it a Catholick Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for a Minister to hold, that a fit person of another Church may not have Communion with him and his Charge, and partake of the Ordinances among them, when they are for a time cast
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:170535:131"/> into their Neighborhood, and give sufficient testimony of their fitness.</p>
               <p n="10">10. It is a dividing uncatho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Principle, to think that for every disorder, or gross sin, that (against our wills) is connived at in the Church, we must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore withdraw from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of that Church, before sufficient meanes and patience have been used with them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church do own the sin.</p>
               <p n="11">11. It is a dividing uncatholick Principle, to hold that we must necessarily require the Profession of more then the Essentials of Christianity, in order to the baptizing of any into the Church; Or that Profession is no satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory evidence, (though there be no proof on the contrary to invalidate it,) unless there be some other discovery of the
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:170535:132"/> truth of grace. To deny the Catholick qualification of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible members, is not Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick.</p>
               <p n="12">12. It is a dividing, and not a Catholick Principle, that we must needs preach, profess or declare every thing that we take to be a truth, though to the apparent hazard of the Church, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance of the great Essential truths; and that no truth must be silenced, for the Churches peace, and the advantage of the more necessary truths. And that we may not hold Communion with those that agree not with us in some Integrals of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian faith, though they agree in the Essentials, and forfeit not the Communion of the Church by wicked lives.</p>
               <p>Too many more such Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples might be named: But I onely warn you briefly of these few.</p>

               <p>A <hi>Catholick Love</hi> cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>steth in these particulars, 1. That you <hi>Love a Christian as a Christian, for the sake of Christ,</hi> and not for by-respects onely: not chiefly because he is Rich or honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or of eminent place or parts, or personage, or because he loveth you, or any such lower respects: though these may have their place in subservity to the main: But the chief Reason of your Love must be, because he is a member of Christ, and
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:170535:133"/> beareth his Image, and is ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to the glory of God, and one that is like to joyn with you in his everlasting praises.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That your Love may be Catholick, it must be a Love to all that are Christians, as far as you can discern them, and have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to observe them. Though he should differ from you in many points of Religion, yet if he hold the Essentials, and manifest the grace of God in his life, you must love him with the speciall Love of a Christian. Though he have fallen out with you, or wronged you by word or deed, or have a low esteem of you, and sleight you (whether deservedly, or on a mistake) yet if he manifest the Image of God, by his holy Profession, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, you must affoard him this speciall Christian Love. Though he be a <hi>very weak</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:170535:133"/> of parts, or graces, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to passions and infirmities, (consistent with grace) and his Profession reach not to that heigth as may make him eminent, nor his life to that degree of dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, as may make you confident of his sincerity, yet if he have <hi>a Profession of true Faith and Repentance, and Holiness seemingly serious, and not invalidated or disproved by a contrary Profession or Practice,</hi> you must allow him the speciall Love of a Christian. He that loveth a Christian as a Christian, must needs love all Christians, that he discerneth to be such: And he must not by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableness, hinder that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And Catholick Love will be somewhat suitable to the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the object, which is a member of Christ. He that loveth a Christian truly, doth love him
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:170535:134"/> above Gold and Silver, and worldly things; and therefore can part with his substance to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him, and venture his life for him, when God and his honour do require it. And therefore it is that Christ will not at the last day, barely ask, whether we have loved him in his members; but whether our Love were such as could carry us to cloa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h and feed, and visit and re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ieve them to our power.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Lastly, Catholick Love must be diversifyed in the Degree according to the apparent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of mens Graces and service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness to God. He that loveth men as Christians and godly, will love those best where he seeth most Christianity and Godliness, and those least where he seeth least of it.</p>
               <p>There is 1. A common Love of men as men; and this you owe to all, even to an enemy: and this
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:170535:134"/> may consist with a dislike or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of them as wicked and Gods enemies. 2. There is a Love to men for some Lovely, Naturall, or acquired parts; as wit, learning, eloquence, gentleness, a loving nature, and the like: And this is proper to them that are the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied objects of it; you owe it not to all, and yet you may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it to those that are no Saints. But this is not the Catholick Love which I speak of. 3. There is the foredescribed Love to a Christian, as a Christian: and this is the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Love which is due to all that seem Christians. 4. There is a <hi>speciall Degree</hi> of this Love, which you owe to stronger and more excellent Christians, and to those whose Profession and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation doth put you into a more confident perswasion of their sincerity, then you have of many or most common Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors.
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:170535:135"/> And this <hi>speciall Degree</hi> is not due to <hi>all Christians.</hi> As we have but very <hi>small and doubtfull</hi> perswasions of <hi>some mens</hi> since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and <hi>more confident</hi> perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of others; so our Love must be <hi>greater</hi> to one then to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, even where a <hi>speciall Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Love</hi> is due to them all. 5. There is a speciall <hi>suitableness</hi> in the spirits of but few, even of those that are stronger Christians, whereby they are fitted to be your bosom friends. And this extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Love of a bosom friend, such as was between <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Jonathan,</hi> and should be between Husbands and Wives, is not due to all, no not all that are strong Christians.</p>
               <p>For Naturall Love to Parents and Children, and other naturall relations; and for Grateful Love to Benefactors, I shall say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to them, as not pertaining
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:170535:135"/> to our business; nor yet of the heavenly degree of Love which is proper to Glory. But I have shewed you what that speciall Christian Love is which is truly Catholick; and that it must be to all, and to all with a high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; but not to all with an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall degree, but must be much diversifyed by their Degrees of grace.</p>
               <p>The Love which is called, <hi>The fulfilling of the Law,</hi> containeth all these sorts beforementioned: but the Love which is <hi>the new Commandement of the Gospel,</hi> is this speciall endearedness of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians to one another in their <hi>new relation,</hi> even 1. As they <hi>believe in the Messiah as come,</hi> in whom they are all fellow members and Brethren; and 2. As they are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possessed and elevated to this Love, by a <hi>speciall measure of sanctification by the spirit,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:170535:136"/> to Gospel times.</p>
               <p>This is <hi>the Love to the Brethren,</hi> by which we may <hi>know that we are translated from death to life,</hi> and so that we are true Catholick Christians, 1 John 3. 14. <hi>He that hath not this Love abideth in death. By this</hi> it is that <hi>all men must know us to be Christs Disciples,</hi> that is, Catholick Christians, 1 John 13. 33. If Christ have more skill in knowing his own sheep and sheepmark, then the Papists have, then this is a better mark of a Catholick, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in the Pope, as the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall Soveraign of the Church: even loving one another as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, for Christs sake, and that <hi>with a pure heart fervently,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 22. <hi>Not in word and tongue, but in deed and truth,</hi> so as to part with worldly goods for our brethrens relief, 1 Joh. 3. 17, 18. Mat. 25. 34, 40.</p>
               <pb n="257" facs="tcp:170535:136"/>
               <p> Reader, Thou art a blessed man, if thou hast this charitable Catholick spirit; that thou canst love all Christians, as far as thou canst discern them, with a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Christian Love. When o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers hate and reproach all those that are not of their sect, or at least have no speciall Christian Love for them, let them be dear to thy heart, and amiable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the Image and Interest of thy Lord, even when thou art called to disown and rebuke (yea or chasten, if a Governour) their errors and imperfections. This Lesson is written in the very heart of a true Catholick; for <hi>they are all taught of God to love one another,</hi> 1 Thes. 4. 9. Those therefore that maligne all dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and malice those that are not of their party, do carry about with them the brand of Sectaries, how much soever they may seem
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:170535:137"/> to detest them. Those that deny the essentials of Christianity, are not the Objects of Christian Love, (but of common Love onely:) but whatever infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are consistent with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, are insufficient to excuse us from this speciall Love.</p>
               <p>And here let me mind you of one other Principle, which is notoriously <hi>uncatholick,</hi> while it pretendeth to be <hi>most Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi> and is here most fitly to be mentioned, as being the bane of <hi>Catholick Christian Love.</hi> And that is the Doctrine of many <hi>Papists,</hi> and some few <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,</hi> that make the <hi>necessary qualification of a Church-member</hi> to be (the reality <hi>Coram Deo,</hi> and the profession, <hi>Coram Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi> of) a kind of <hi>Dogmaticall faith,</hi> which is short of <hi>justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith.</hi> From whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:170535:137"/> that <hi>visible</hi> Church-members as such, are <hi>not to be taken by us,</hi> for true living mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the body of Christ; but <hi>that esteem</hi> is due onely to <hi>some few that manifest their Holiness by an extraordinary profession,</hi> or fuller discovery: and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that we are not bound to love any as living members of Christ, but such <hi>eminent profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors:</hi> And so the speciall Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Love, which is the New Commandement, and the badge of a Disciple, is turned into a <hi>common Love specifically different</hi> from it, and answerable to the <hi>common not-justifying faith:</hi> and the <hi>speciall Catholick Love</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served as another thing, for some few of the visible Church: Whereas indeed, we may say of all that are duly visible mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, by profession of a saving faith (not nulled) that as it is
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:170535:138"/> the <hi>same faith</hi> with that of the holiest Saints which they <hi>profess,</hi> so is it the same specifick Love that's due to the holiest Saint that they must be loved with: A great difference there must be in <hi>Degree;</hi> but none in <hi>kind.</hi> We love <hi>none</hi> of them as <hi>infallibly known</hi> to be true <hi>living</hi> Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, but <hi>all of them</hi> as <hi>probably</hi> such, by Profession; but with very different degrees, because of the different degrees of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability.</p>
               <p>And let me add another cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Principle, that tendeth to corrupt this Catholick Love; and that is theirs, that would have the Church lie common, and men that profess not saving faith, or that null that Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by a wicked impenitent course of life, to be permitted in the Church and Dilcipline laid aside, and so the common and
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:170535:138"/> unclean to be numbered with the visible Saints. And so when the permitted members are such as by right are no members, nor so much as seeming Saints, they cannot be the objects of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Love. Destroy the object, and you destroy the Art.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The second Catholick Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is <hi>Compassion</hi> towards a Christian as a Christian in his sufferings. A sensibleness of their sufferings, as <hi>if we suffered with them,</hi> Heb. 13. 3. 1 Cor. 12. 26. <hi>And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it, or one member be honoured, all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers rejoyce with it.</hi> Rom. 12. 15, 16. <hi>Rejoyce with them that do rejoyce, and weep with them that weep: be of the same mind one towards another.</hi> 2 Cor. 11. 29. <hi>Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is offended, and I burn not?]</hi> A true Catholick is grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:170535:139"/> to see his Brothers calamity, and specially to hear of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and losses and sufferings of the Churches: be they never so distant from him, it is near to his heart, for their interest is his own. He that feels nothing but his <hi>Own</hi> afflictions, and can make a small matter of the losses and sufferings of the Church (perhaps under pretence of trusting God,) so that if all be but well with himself, is certainly no Catholick or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian. And he that little feels the losses of the Church, if his own sect or party do but gain or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease by it, doth shew that he hath more of a Sectary then of a Christian. Catholick <hi>Compassion</hi> (to which I adjoyn also Catholick <hi>Rejoycing)</hi> do prove a true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick,</p>
               <p n="3">III. Another Catholick Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, is a <hi>speciall care</hi> of the common Christian state and
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:170535:139"/> Cause, and of the Case of all our Brethren, that are known to us. I mean not that care which belongs to God onely, and which we are forbidden to use, even for our selves; but 1. are estimation of the Interest of the Church and Brethren as our own, and 2. an ordinate solicitousness about their welfare, containing an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest desire of it, and a care, to use the meanes that should obtain it. A Catholick spirit is busily carefull about the Churches and Brethrens wellfare as well as his own, 1 Cor. 12. 25. <hi>[That there should be no schisme in the Body, but that the members should have the same care one for another.]</hi> Phil. 2. 20. Timothy <hi>naturally cared</hi> for the state of the Churches: such a care <hi>by Grace</hi> he had of the Churches, as he had <hi>by Nature</hi> of himself; proceeding from so deep a Love, as was a kind of new
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:170535:140"/> Nature to him, 2 Cor. 7. 12. <hi>[That our care for you in the sight of God might appear to you.]</hi> 2 Cor. 8. 16. <hi>Titus</hi> had an earnest care for the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> Every Pastor must have a care of his Church, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 5. but not stop there; but with <hi>Paul, [have a care of all the Churches,]</hi> 2 Cor. 11. 28. though not an Apostolicall charge of them like his. Careles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Church and Brethren is not Catholick.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Lastly, A true Catholick Spirit, must appear, in Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick <hi>Endeavours</hi> for the good of all the members of the Church. 1. Its contrary to a <hi>base covetous selfish spirit,</hi> which causeth men to mind and seek onely their own, and not the things of Jesus Christ, and of their Brethren: and will not allow men to part with any more then some inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable pittance out of their su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:170535:140"/> for their Brethrens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief or the Churches service, 1 Joh. 3. 17. <hi>But who so hath this worlds goods, and seeth his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath need, and shutteth up his bowels of Compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?</hi> He that cannot pinch him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and deny himself even in his daily bread for the Church and Brethren, when God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth it, is not a true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Christian.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And its contrary much more to a <hi>spirit of malignity,</hi> by which men envy the good of others, or of those that are not of their party! And yet more to <hi>perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,</hi> when men would tread down and destroy their Brethren, and the Inheritance of the Lord, in a selfish devilish Zeal.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But yet it is not contrary to a <hi>charitable moderate correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of offendors,</hi> which tendeth
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:170535:141"/> either to their own or the Churches good, and is necessary to the restraint of iniquity, and the preserving of others from the infection of error. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the sword of the Magistrate and the Discipline of the Church, must both be imployed in the Cause of God; and this is so far from being contrary to the endeavours of a Catholick spirit, that it is a necessary part of it. Correction first proceedeth from Love, and secondly, tendeth to good, and thirdly, is not used but in necessity; and this differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from persecution, as the whipping of a Child, from the malignant hurting of the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</p>

Maintain Catholick Affections in others to your power, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to draw them from private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of spirit, and selfish or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding affections. 3. Endeavour
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:170535:142"/> the actuall healing of breaches, among all Catholicks as soon as you perceive them. To that end, 1. Acquaint your selves with heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Truths; and labour to be as skilfull in the work of pacifying and agreeing men, as most are in the work of dividing and disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing. Know it to be a part of your Catholick work to be Peacemakers; and therefore study how to do it as a workman that needeth not be ashamed. I think most Divines themselves in the world, do study differences a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred houres, for one houre that ever they study the healing of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences; and that's a shamefull disproportion. 2. Do not bend all your wits to find what more may be said against others, and to make the differences as wide as you can; but study as hard to find out mens Agreements, and to reduce the differences to as nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:170535:142"/> a compass as is possible. 3. And to that end, be sure that you see the true state of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie, and distinguish all that is meerly verball, from that which is materiall, and that which is but about Methods and Modes, and Circumstances, from that which is about substantiall truths; and that which is about inferior truths, though weighty, from that which is about the Essentials of Christianity. 4. Be as industrious for Peace among others as if you smarted by it your self: seek it, and beg it, and follow it, and take no nay. Make it the work of your lives. <hi>When once God hath so awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened the hearts of his servants to see the beauty, and feel so much of the necessity of Ʋnity and Peace in the Church, as shall make them ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally more zealous, and diligent and unwearied in seeking them, then Dividers are in seeking to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy</hi>
                     <pb n="270" facs="tcp:170535:143"/>
                     <hi>them, then may we expect a healing, and strength and glory to the Catholick Church:</hi> But wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will not serve the turn, nor will we much thank wishers for it, if we be healed.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, Lay the Unity of the Church, upon nothing but what is Essential to the Church. Seek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as much truth, and purity and perfection as you can: but not as necessary to the Essence of the Church, or any member of it; nor to denominate and speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie your Faith and Religion by. Tolerate no error or sin, so far as <hi>not to seek the healing of it:</hi> but tolerate all error and sin, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting with Christian Faith and Charity, so far as <hi>not to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christen and unchurch men for them. Own</hi> no mans <hi>Errors</hi> or <hi>sins,</hi> but <hi>own</hi> every <hi>man</hi> that <hi>owneth Christ,</hi> and whom <hi>Christ will own,</hi> notwithstanding those
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:170535:143"/> errors and infirmities that he is guilty of. Bear with those that Christ will bear with, especially learn the master duty of <hi>self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyall:</hi> For it is selfe that is the greatest Enemy to Catholicisme. Self-conceitedness and self-Love, and self-willedness, and selfish in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests, are the things that divide, and would make as many Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the world, as selfes. Even among many accounted Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, Pride and selfishness causeth them so far to overvalue their own judgements, as to expect, that all should be conformable to them, and bow to their Arguments which have no strength, if not to their say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and wills without their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: and to disdain, and passionately censure and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, all that dissent and gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say them. And thus every man, so far as he is proud and selfish;
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:170535:144"/> would be the Pope or Center of the Catholick Church. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is observable, that Christ hath told us, <hi>That except we be converted and become as little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, we cannot enter into his Kingdom,</hi> Matth. 18. 3. <hi>And if we deny not our selves, we cannot be his Disciples,</hi> Luk. 9. 23. But of this I have spoken in another Treatise.</p>

            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <p>And thus I have plainly from the word of God, declared to you the true nature of Catholicisme, and which is the Catholick Church, and who a Catholick. I hope it may do somewhat to cure the frensie of the world, that makes men cry, Here is the Church, and there is the Church. that makes one Sect say, We are the Church, and another say, We are the Church. I hope it may do
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:170535:144"/> somewhat to the confounding of the arrogancy, and presumption of all Sects, especially the Sect of Papists, that being but a piece of the Church, and that none of the best, dare pretend to be the whole, and restrain the name of Catholicks or Christians to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves! And I hope it may do somewhat to awake the servants of Christ, to more Catholick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations, and Principles, and Affections and endeavours; that those that have lived too much to themselves, and too much to their own parties, as if the Church had been confined to their narrow Provinces, may hereafter look more abroad into the world; and remember the extent of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Christ, and not think so dishonourably of it as they have done. I hope also it may help to abate the censoriousness and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption of those, that would
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:170535:145"/> rob Christ of the greatest part of his Inheritance, and deliver it up to Satan his enemy. And I hope it may somewhat disgrace the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding Principles and Practices of these times, and turn Souldiers into Surgeons, wounding into healing, and excite in some, a stronger desire for Unity and Peace, and cause them to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their care and charity fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then they have done. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, this here described, is the Catholick Church which God will own. This is it that's built on Christ the Rock, which the gates of Hell shall not prevail against. Here is the safe standing from whence you may look with bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, thankfulness, and compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, upon the many Sects, and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious contentions of the world, and lament their giddiness, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being brought your selves to a losse about the truth of your
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:170535:145"/> Church or faith. And may see the folly of them that are puzled to find out the true Catholick Church and Religion. And here you may see the admirable pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of a truly Regenerate sanctified person, that is most certainly a member of the true Catholick Church, whoever deny it. To conclude, you may hence see, that it is not as <hi>Romanists, Greeks, Armenians, Abassines, Jacobines, Lutherans, Calvinists, Arminians, &amp;c.</hi> that men are sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; but as Catholick Christians, aspiring to the highest Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>

Lest you should be so unhappy as to misse this Pearl, you may know it by a couple of exquisite Poems, next following the Epistle: The first of them beginneth thus:</p>

               <l>Read on good Reader, but read aright;</l>
               <l>Do not mistake, nor construe things in spight.</l>
               <l>'Tis a proud word to speak, yet true I ween,</l>
               <l>That such a Book as this you have seldom seen:</l>

               <l> All Books this Christmas, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vain men do look,</l>

            <p>And that you may know he takes not Christmasse for a thing indifferent, and is farre enough from my opinion, who think the Churches Unity and Peace, should not be laid on it, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints you in the next Poeme with our errour in the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals.</p>

               <l>The Article of his Birth-day they do deny</l>

               <l>And not to account it any fault or crime:</l>
               <l>This feast of Christ hath been highly kept of yore:</l>
               <l>And never yet esteemed Popery before.</l>

            <p>Who can choose but be wooed into Unity and Peace, by such sweet melodious charms as these? I prethee <hi>Reader,</hi> do not laugh, because he hath (prophanely) interwoven the reverend name of Christ. But to assure you, that he speaketh truth, and save you the labour of examining his evidence, his companion, <hi>T. J. (T. Jordan)</hi> in an Epistle suitable to the work, hath offered you this full satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <hi>[I dare say, and will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that the Authour hereof hath written herein, nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the will of God.]</hi> You see now a Confutation would come too late. How <hi>[Nothing but what is true!]</hi> The first words are, <hi>[The Question pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded</hi>
               <pb n="282" facs="tcp:170535:149"/>
               <hi>by</hi> R. B. <hi>&amp;c. Whether the Nativity of Christ, commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Christmasse day ought to be ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated.</hi> R.

            </p>
            <p>But he tells you never a word, when and where I stated and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued this case: nor what proof he hath that his Notary hath not deceived him.</p>
            <p>I must provoke the Reader on this occasion to pity this poor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted Nation, whose Rulers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate all that will, not onely in Print to belie their Neighbours, but to fill the ears of the people through the Land, with their ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>non-</hi>sence, and horrid abuse of the name of God, as if it were desirable to bring contempt upon the Christian Name and Cause, and to make writings called Theological, to become of
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:170535:149"/> equal repute with Play-books, or the tales of <hi>Scoggin,</hi> or <hi>Tom Thumb.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Question and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments recited by this man, they are none of mine. He throws in your faces the snivell of his own nose, and would make you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it was not the excrements of <hi>his</hi> brain, but mine. I know the occasion of it was from a Sermon which I preached divers years ago, on the day he pleads for. In which I told them, that I would neither plead for Christmasse-day, nor against it, but laboured to bring them to obey the Spirit of Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear judging or despising one another upon this account. To those that numbred it with things indifferent, I spoke not: But to those that could not be content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their own liberty, but uncharitably reviled all that were
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:170535:150"/> not of their mind, and reproacht their Teachers on this account, and would persecute all by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence that would not keep this day, and follow them, the rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble throwing stones and dirt into their shops and houses, and breaking their windows (which occasioned my speech) I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to tender them some of those Reasons, which the <hi>contrary minded</hi> gave to <hi>excuse themselves</hi> from the observing of this day, <hi>as necessary to be observed.</hi> And some scraps of these Reasons, broken and mangled, some Scrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, it seems hath given to this man. And the Consuter or the Scribe had not brains or honesty enough to distinguish between a <hi>[may be]</hi> and a <hi>[must be]</hi> and between <hi>[a temporary accidental duty]</hi> and <hi>[an universal perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent necessity, or duty]</hi> between <hi>[accusing the keepers]</hi> and <hi>[ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing</hi>
               <pb n="285" facs="tcp:170535:150"/>
               <hi>some for not keeping the day.]</hi> I pleaded but for <hi>Charity to the non-observers, and Ʋnity notwithstanding such a difference;</hi> and so have incurd the fury of these charitable men. My own opinion I have fully opened in my <hi>Disputat. of Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> I deny not but this, as other things indifferent, may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a temporary duty to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular persons or societies, by some accident (as the avoiding scandal, the obeying the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> But that it is a <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent duty to the Ʋniversal Church by any Law of God or man, to keep this day,</hi> I now deny: or that it is <hi>lawfull</hi> for any man to keep it, <hi>as a day of Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,</hi> and <hi>so of necessity to be kept.</hi> And I wish Father <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pas</hi> would vouchsafe me the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation of an hour or two's dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation with him on this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:170535:151"/> And for both the Case and Arguments, if he had but so much cared what he saith or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisheth, as to endeavour faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to know first, whether it be true or false, he might have sent to me, and I would have found him work, or he might have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of some better Notaries, that could have shew'd him the Case and Arguments were other, than he here sets down. He knowes how the omission of a word may make all seem ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing: Much more such a childish recitall, as he hath published. What therefore can the Book be, but a ludicrous fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, a talking to his sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, when he feigneth the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion (which was none of mine) and giveth us such scraps under the name of Arguments, that I must say by the charge are made his own.</p>
            <pb n="287" facs="tcp:170535:151"/>
            <p> I think no body (that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him and me at least) will expect from me a line of Repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to this Disputant; I know I shall be blamed for taking so much notice of him, as I have done. But that which I observe (as pertinent to the fore-going Discourse) is the lamentable case that the Church is in, through the uncharitable, imperious, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious spirit, of that generation of men, that condemn the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Lord, as so many gracelesse wretches, because they keep not Christmasse-day; and <hi>defie</hi> them, and would cast them out of the Church, and lay the peace of the Church upon such circumstances, when God hath as plainly condemned that course in <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. as can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. Hear the <hi>Charity</hi> of this our Box-maker, <hi>pag.</hi> 19. <hi>[I am verily perswaded in my soule</hi>
               <pb n="288" facs="tcp:170535:152"/>
               <hi>and conscience, that whosoever is truly, really and sincerely addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and devoted to Christ, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can nor will speake a word amisse against the due Festivity and solemnity of this day.]</hi> And he had not the wit to forbear an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexing the words of <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 5. to tell you, that he point blank contradicteth the holy Ghost. The holy Ghost forbids the <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them that esteem each day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, because to the Lord they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it not,</hi> and calls such, <hi>The servants of the Lord,</hi> yea and the <hi>stronger</hi> sort of Christians, (as to the instances in the Text) and plainly shews, that such dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences about dayes should not make divisions in the Church, but each party should forbear the other. But this Refuter, bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly steps into the seat of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and condemneth every one in the world, that speaks a
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:170535:152"/> word amisse against Christmasse, as not truly, really and sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly devoted to Christ, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently no true Christian, but the child of the Devil. And he layeth his soul and conscience on it. See here the sobriety, the charity, the peaceablenesse of these men. Is it possible for Unity and Concord to flourish, where this spirit, and these prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples prevail? Yes: so farre as clubs and halters can procure it. When Christmasse day is made an Article of our faith, yea a fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental, without which no man can be truly <hi>addicted and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Christ</hi> (and so be saved,) no wonder if these men will have communion with none but Christmasse-keepers. Yet these as well as the Papists, think that <hi>they</hi> are the right Catholicks and promoters of the <hi>Ʋnity</hi> of the Church, who damn or exclude
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:170535:153"/> all that receive not the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which the presumptuous U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpers of Christs Legislative Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, have turned into Articles of Faith, or imposed as Necessary on their brethren.</p>
            <p>But the Malignity of Father <hi>Malpas</hi> riseth yet higher, and scorns the works of God them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, <hi>pag.</hi> 79. he saith, of his own, or his Notaries fiction, which he falsly calleth my eleventh As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>[It is a meer falshood and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest untruth,</hi> (the more is his shame, that filleth up his Box with such) <hi>and no more to be credited or believed, than that vain fancie, and fond surmise of yours, I mean the fable and story you tell us of in your Saints Rest, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the raining down of Manna on the leads of the Church at</hi> Bridgnorth <hi>when you preached there: for some Gentlemen of</hi>

That I said it was Manna, or that it was when I preached at <hi>Bridgnorth,</hi> are some of the falshoods which he hath stuft his Libel with. But for the story it self, this is the truth, upon the word of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.</p>
            <p>When I came to live with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Mr. <hi>William Madestard</hi> at <hi>Bridgnorth,</hi> he and many others told me of a grain that had been rained down there a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:170535:154"/> The notice they had of it, was thus: As they sate together in the house, they thought a small storm of hail had ratled upon the windows, and marvelled, because it was not a season for hail: but they suspected nothing else. Shortly after as they went out of doors, they saw in the walk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the door a deal of corn, as they then imagined, scattered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, which they thought had been Rie, which some one had shed that passed that way; and so neglected it, till it was all trodden in the dirt. But when some neighbours askt them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they saw the corn, that was then rained, and affirmed it to be true, they thought better of it, and went up on the leads, both of the Church, and of the House, and found the grain, and gathered it, and kept it.

               <hi>Richard Swaine</hi> Minister at <hi>Cleroe</hi> in <hi>Radnorshire,</hi> were there when it was told me, and I think when it was done; both godly, faithfull, able Ministers, yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, of whom any man may make enquiry.

               <hi>Madestards,</hi> now a Minister, and his daughters were then so young, that I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they remember it or not; but I suppose the daughters may. I desired them to shew me some of the grain; and Mistress <hi>Grey</hi> fetcht me part of her store (the rest having given theirs away:) I kept part of it about three or four years: part of it I tasted, but did not let it down. It was no grain that ever I saw be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; nor could I by any Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal, conjecture what it might be. It was likest to Rie, or small wheat, but was not either. It had a skin somewhat thicker and darker coloured than a Rie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn; and when that was taken off, the substance under (dark coloured also) was almost like a Rie corn in the skinne (but plainly to be differenced:) The taste of it was somewhat sharp
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:170535:155"/> or biting, but not very much: almost like a dried Yvie-berry, (but nothing like it in shape;) not so hot as a Juniper-berry. I have spoke with other credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble persons, that assured me it fell in other Countreys at the same time. And now let this grain go for Haw-stones, and Jackdaws excrements, with such as take pleasure to feed their minds with the excrements of malignant brains. I thought this unusual providence of God, not fit to be unobserved, nor to be left to the derision of ignorance and malice.</p>

               <hi>Malpas</hi> himself should think he hath any cause to complain of the Presbyterians, or of me, for such undermining of him. It is twenty years since I once heard him preach, much after the rate that here he writes; and since fame accused him of being too familiar with a Cup of <hi>Nimi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>:</hi> I never heard of any Presbyterians in his Parish; and yet long since the warres, I have heard him accused by one of his Parishioners at least, and many others, as a Railer, a Swearer, a horrid Curser, a Fighter, a Drunkard, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And though I was importuned to assist them in prosecuting him upon these Accusations, and I never spoke with one man that
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:170535:156"/> justified him, or that did once question the truth of the Charge (to my remembrance) yet I think he will not say, that I did prosecute him: and yet he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyeth his place, as formerly: And after that, when as an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistant with the Commissioners, I saw new Articles preferr'd or tendered against him (because they said, That the Act of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion, and a bargain with his Neighbours, had saved him from the former,) I medled not with him. And fince that I have had an accusation in writing, under the witness hand, of his fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in another Parish, as was verily believed in his drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, yet I never made use of it against him, but buried it in silence. Yet I must intreat the Reader, that he will not hence censure me, as one that consent to such mens being in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry;
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:170535:157"/> or as one that hold Communion with men of such a Character. But I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, I would not go beyond my Calling under pretence of doing a good work: Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, I freely professe, that I take it to be one of the best works I can do, when God calls me to it, to deliver the misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble people from Pastours of this quality, and help them to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in their stead, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the casting out such unsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury salt, that is good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to be trodden under feet, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 13. And I must confesse the man hath taken the most subtil course that I can think of, to prevent his Ejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the time to come. For now he hath thus learnedly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended Christmasse, and brought in the Presbyterians and me, as parties, he may imagine, if any
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:170535:157"/> of us should seek to cast him out, the world would judge that we did it in malice and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and that he is not cast out as a Drunkard or Swearer, or Curser, or a fighter, but as a Defender of Christmasse-day: and he may think that to escape so odious an imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, men will let him alone. But what will he do when God shall judg? <hi>It is a fearfull thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as Mr. <hi>M.</hi> rewardeth me for my fore-mentioned forbearance, so doth Mr. <hi>Pierce</hi> for my Charity to some of the Adherents to his way and party. How commonly the whole kennels of Swearers, and Drunkards, and Scorners at Godlinesse, and such like, were continued in the Communion of the Prelaticall Church, is a thing so well known, as need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no words of mine to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:170535:158"/> it, in <hi>England.</hi> Nor yet, how eager the scandalous rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble are for Prelacy, and their mode of Government and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. Hereupon too many god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly people, have been enclined to think too hardly of those wayes and Churches, and to depart somewhat further from them, than they should. And upon this, it grew ordinary with the Prelatical Divines, to speak more favourably of the ongodly scandalous sort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, than others thought they ought to do, sometimes excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing their sinnes as venial, or infirmities, that might consist with Grace, and ordinarily ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the people that walked circumspectly, and durst not runne with others to excesse of riot, to seem to the world the worser sort of the two; either charging them with some heart
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:170535:158"/> sinne, or some generals onely, wherein no man is capable of vindicating himself, (to such unjust accusers) or using some nicknames instead of just accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; either <hi>Purinans,</hi> or (as Mr. <hi>M.</hi> here) <hi>Round-head Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites,</hi> or some such like. Hereupon the minds of many people fearing God, were too farre alienated both from the looser sort among them; and from the Clergy, that gave them so much countenance, (and too many of them, example and company in sinne.) Now when I was endeavouring an Agreement with the better sort of the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that are for Diocesans, and their way, perceiving that this prophanenesse of their Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy and people (afore-described) was the principal impediment of our desired Unity; and also percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that many Ministers were very
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:170535:159"/> fearfull of recerving such people in their Parishes to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and their children to Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptisme, I therefore endeavoured to bring them herein to a just moderation, and to as favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble censures of the more faulty sort, as judgement and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse would allow: that so while they used the notorious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ungodly, as such should be used, they might yet judge no more to be notoriously ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then they needs must. And thus I thought to increase mens Charity, to the Prelaticall Churches, and their Adherents in our Parishes.</p>
            <p>And what doth Mr. <hi>Pierce</hi> by way of requital, but take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of my Charity to his Friends, to make the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that I am guilty of some prophane licentious principles: to teach me the next time to
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:170535:159"/> let men esteem them, and use them as they are, without such lenitives. But to satisfie him, rather than I will be irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or licentious, by excusing the faults of their Adherents or Communicants, or pleading for their too easie Admission to our Communion, I will recant all that he shall prove I have said amisse, and leave them to the judgements of those that have more to do with them than I have. If I saw a man ready to be condemn'd for stealing, and I should say, It's pitty to hang him, because he stole for meer necessity, I should sooner ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that the <hi>prosecutor</hi> should accuse me of <hi>defending thieves,</hi> then the <hi>thief himself,</hi> or his <hi>friends</hi> or <hi>companions.</hi> But thus you see, what hopes we have of Unity and Peace! while on one side, such as Mr. <hi>Pierce</hi> cry
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:170535:160"/> out against the Puritans and Presbyterians, as if they were unmeet for humane Society; and such as Mr. <hi>Malpas</hi> say, <hi>[The Round-hbad Hypocrites do all the wrong;]</hi> And on the other side, some are apt to be too fearfull of holding Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with them, because so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Drunkards, and Cursers, and Swearers, are of their way, and in their Communion, yea and in their Clergy; and when I seek to mollifie exasperated or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended minds, by disswading them from uncharitable cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, I am proclaimed a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sender of mens crimes, and <hi>one</hi> party will neither give me leave to excuse <hi>themselves,</hi> nor <hi>those</hi> that <hi>they accuse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that we may know they can speak falsly in <hi>Latine,</hi> as well as in <hi>English,</hi> I have the same kind of usage from their

               <hi>Philo-Tilenus;</hi> who in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face maketh most passionate complaints, of the horrid abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and injuries which they suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer: Their own mouth praising themselves, while false accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are poured out against o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. If you will believe this man, it's they that are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, peaceable men, and it's we that are the persecutots, and the fire-brands: <hi>They blesse, and we curse: They doe good, and we repay them with injuries: They love us as their bowels, and we hate them: We deale by them, as becomes not either Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, or Christians, or profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours of greatest piety, or as men: We strike them through with fiery maledictions:]</hi> And who are they that we thus use? Why <hi>[Men that deserve all praise, the most learned; the most godly, the strongest, and almost</hi>

Why without a cause, they are said to be <hi>too much addicted to Popery.</hi> And who be those monsters that will do all this? Why <hi>[Baxterus quidam prae cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teris, qui totum Puritanismum totus spirat.]</hi> This sonne of peace to prevent divisions, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominateth them <hi>Baxteriani,</hi> that are their enemies, their cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, and that cast them out; and charitably prayeth to God to be so mercifull to us, that no such evil may befall us, as we have constrained them to suffer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reader,</hi> Wouldst not thou think by all this out cry, that I had affected to head some divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding party? and that I had been some Archbishop, or person of great power, and as great malice,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:170535:161"/> that had persecuted the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and that I and some followers of mine, had cast out the most able, holy Pastours from their places of imployment? Or that I were some implacable ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the Churches Unity and Peace, that had refused their most importunate solicitations for agreement? Or at least, that I had certainly exprest some ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to them? Or at least had given them some injurious words? Though swearers may be called swearers, and drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards may be called drunkards, without any note of incivility in the speaker, yet it is grown com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to take him for a Railer that calleth the most infamous Liar by his name: and therefore I shall only say, that if this Writer, and Mr. <hi>Pierce,</hi> and some other of their way, had half the hatred to sinne, and love to Godliness,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:170535:162"/> or common honesty, which their writings would perswade the world they have, they durst not, they would not have publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the world, so many, so grosse and shamelesse falshoods, and over-acted the part of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusers of the brethren, as they have done.</p>
            <p>And here the <hi>Reader</hi> may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve one great disadvantage, that Books have with our belief, in comparison of the <hi>words</hi> of present men. For the most part, we were not acquainted with the Authors of those Books; nor have full information of the constitution of their consciences, and consequently of their credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; it being easie with such an one as Mr. <hi>Malpas,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pierce, &amp;c.</hi> to tell as smooth a tale to strangers, to make the grossest falshoods seem true, as a man of conscience would do for that
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:170535:162"/> which is truth indeed. But when you discourse with men that you are acquainted with, and know one to be a Drunkard, Swearer, Curser, Liar, and malignant ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to a holy life, and another to fear God, and hate a lie, you will not equally believe them, though they speak with equal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence.</p>
            <p>I shall imitate them so farre upon their provocation, as to challenge rhem, to bring their proof, that ever I persecuted any of them, or cast them out, or once endeavoured it by word or deed, unless for notorious scandal or insufficiency? It will be long before <hi>this Countrey</hi> will believe them (who laugh, or shake the head at the silly ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of these calumniators;) but perhaps they may be believed in another Countrey, where the things are utterly unknown; or
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:170535:163"/> in anothet age, that judgeth of words by their plausible and confident pretendings to be true.</p>
            <p>Which of them is it that I have hated, or repaid with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledictions, and with wrongs? Which of them did seek Peace with me, and can say, that I refused it? When I can truly say, that when I have spent a great part of many years, in seeking it of some of them, by word and writing, they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected it, and writ against the motion, and drawn off some that began to yield. And though in half an hour I fully agreed with that Reverend Archbishop <hi>Ʋsher,</hi> upon the terms which should reconcile the moderate of the Prelatical and Presbyterian way, yet I was never the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er attaining any such recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, with the party
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:170535:163"/> that now I have to doe with.</p>
            <p>And for the Ejecting them, and bringing misery on them, it's divers years since I publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my desire, in the Preface to the Reformed Pastor, in these words, <hi>[I desire nothing more, than that all able, godly, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Ministers, of what side soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, in our late State-differences, may not onely have liberty, but encouragement. For the Church hath not any such to spare, were they ten times more. In a word, I would have those, of what par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty soever, to have liberty to preach the Gospel, whose er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours or miscarriages are not so great, as that probably they will not doe as much hurt as good.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not many years ago, since abundance of godly Ministers were silenced and suspended by
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:170535:164"/> the Bishops, and abundance of honest private Christians, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and undone, or driven out of the Land, as <hi>New-England</hi> witnesseth; where men as wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to live in <hi>England</hi> as any of they, were fain to seek them a place of quietness, in a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness in so remote a part of the world. And for my self, they openly sought my life, by unjust accusations, though God delivered me. And now when I have a while enjoyed a little peace, and used it according to my small abilities, in seeking Unity with them and others, and never once motioned the sufferings of any of them, but have publickly protested against it, I am made the leader of their haters, ejecters, and unpeaceable, malicious persecutors. For my part, I know not what interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of their words, can free
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:170535:164"/> them from the guilt of most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent calumniation, unless they take themselves to be thus hated, persecuted and abused, when they are not permitted to rule over us, and silence, and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, as they lately did: and unless they are thus abused, when we refuse to make them the Lords of the Church, and of our Consciences and Liberties, if not our Lives.</p>
            <p>If telling them of their former or present faults, be the <hi>[fiery maledictions]</hi> which I am accused of, I shall only tell them, <hi>That he that being oft reproved harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed without remedy.</hi> And that impenitency will one day be found more hurtfull to them, then faithfull, tender, moderate reproof: And I will remind them of the words of a late godly, truly peaceable Bishop that
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:170535:165"/> knew these matters (Bishop <hi>Hall Modest offer,</hi> pag. 3.) <hi>I should be a flatterer of the times past, if I should take upon me to justifie or approve of all the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages of some that have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted with the Keys of Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Government; or to blanch over the corruptions of Consisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Officers: In both these there was fault enough, to ground both a Complaint and Reformation. And may that man never prosper, that desires not a happy Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of whatsoever hath been, or is amisse in the Church of God.]</hi> Thus he. And must I fall under your heavy accusations, because I will not fall under this heavy curse, and because I say, as this peaceable Bishop said before me?</p>
            <p>But perhaps it is from my own Confessions that <hi>Philo-Tilenus</hi> accuseth me, in imitation of
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:170535:165"/> Mr. <hi>Pierce.</hi> But sure I have no where confessed that I hate them, or persecute them, or cast them out. And if Mr. <hi>Pierce</hi> were of my belief, he would denominate men from the qualities that are predominant in them, and not from every remnant of evil which they lament. I will not say, that man is a <hi>Liar,</hi> that affirmeth me <hi>to confesse my self an Hypocrite,</hi> because I say▪ <hi>I am aware of Hypocrisie within me</hi> (which I must yet confesse, but hope the day of perfect vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory is neer, when I shall have no need to confesse and lament it any more.) But I perceive I may have Mr. <hi>Pierce</hi>'s own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to tell the world, That <hi>[there is no truth in him]</hi> which is his ordinary Confession in the Book of Common-prayer. And the swarm of falshoods which I find in his Book do make me
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:170535:166"/> fear his Confession comes too near the truth.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Pierce</hi> will infallibly prove me an Hypocrite: For <hi>[either my Confession, is true or not: If it be true, I am an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, because I say it in since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: if false I am an Hypocrite, because I am not when I say I am.]</hi> pag. 174. Very good: <hi>I am an Hypocrite, because I am not,</hi> &amp;c. It seems it is Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie to seem worse than I am. But by <hi>Hypocrisie</hi> I mean (not a purposed dissimulation, but) [a seeming better than I am in any one particular.] And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if I have one expression in publick prayer that exceedeth the Affection which it seemeth to expresse, I take my self to have so much Hypocrisie. But I love those that can truly say, they have no such Hypocrisie, (that is, the perfect Saints in Heaven.)</p>
            <pb n="317" facs="tcp:170535:166"/>
            <p> But how proves he this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of mine? He saith <hi>[When you proclaim your self an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite (for so you did from the Presse, or I had not read it,</hi> Disp. 5. of Sacr. pag. 484.) <hi>you cannot blame me for my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> But God will blame you for this, and abundance more impudent falshoods, which your Book is stuft with. And if <hi>Peter</hi> was certainly again dead in sinne, and needed another Regeneration, upon his fall, are you in a safer state that delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately sinne thus so often in one Volume? When God saith, <hi>[A false witnesse shall not be unpuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, and he that speaketh lies shall not escape,</hi> Prov. 19. 5. <hi>He shall perish,</hi> vers. 9. <hi>[These things doth the Lord hate: A proud look, a lying tongue,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>A false-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse that speaketh lies, and he</hi>
               <pb n="322" facs="tcp:170535:167"/>
               <hi>that soweth discord among Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,]</hi> Prov. 6. 16, 17, 19. <hi>[Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lips are abomination to the Lord,</hi> Prov. 12. 22. Rev. 21. 27. <hi>[There shall in no wise enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it any thing that defileth, nor whosoever maketh a lie,] Revel.</hi> 22. 15, <hi>[Without are dogs,—and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.]</hi> If God allow me time, I may perhaps present you with a Catalogue of the fictions which you have published in this one Book, to further your Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or leave you unexcusable. I am so farre from proclaiming my self an Hypocrite, that I shall imitate <hi>Job</hi> in holding fast mine integrity, I hope against Satan and all his instruments. I will not believe that they proclaimed themselves <hi>Infidels</hi> that said, <hi>[Lord, increase our Faith: I believe, Lord help mine unbelief.]</hi> Nor that he calls himself <hi>[an</hi>
               <pb n="323" facs="tcp:170535:167"/>
               <hi>Atheist or Enemy to God]</hi> that lamenteth some relicts of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theisme or Enmity within him.</p>
            <p>This Argument is as strong against you, [If you say true, when you say, <hi>[There is no truth in you]</hi> then there is none: If false, then you speak falsly to God.] And the first is your or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary confession in your Books, and not feigned of you, as that is, which you so often speak of me; and let the Papists that watch for such advantage imitate you at their peril.</p>
            <p>And at least I must say, How happy a man, or how great a Pharisee is Mr. <hi>Pierce,</hi> that hath no degree of Hypocrisie or pride? and that can say, That I <hi>[know nothing by him, but that he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth against sinne.]</hi> Would you have believed this, if you had read but his Discovery! Yea, or
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:170535:168"/> if you believed not the <hi>Quakers</hi> and <hi>Papists</hi> Doctrine of Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the <hi>Pelagians</hi> against Original Sinne, or the Papists, that it ceaseth to be sinne in the baptized?</p>
            <p>But it is my intimating <hi>[That the most Learned, pious, and</hi> tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum-non, <hi>the Champions of the Reformed Religion, are too much addicted to Popery,]</hi> that is my crime. But</p>
            <p n="1">1. That is not <hi>hatred, persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or <hi>extermination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. And who are they of whom I have spoken this? Only of <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> and all that are of his mind. If these men are not of his mind, I never spoke it of any of them. Till Mr. <hi>Pierce</hi> professed himself to be so much of his mind, as to own even the gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest passages in his <hi>Discussio,</hi> &amp;c. in which <hi>Grotius</hi> owneth Popery, I did not, I durst not have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:170535:168"/> so much by him: (And now by disclaiming the worst of <hi>Grotius,</hi> he gives us hope that he is not so bad, as before he would have made us believe he is, in his intellectuals:) <hi>pag.</hi> 202. he saith, <hi>[The Prelatists are not agreeable to</hi> Grotius, <hi>in that, for which he was most suspected; to wit, his thinking that the Bull of</hi> Pius Quintus <hi>may (for peace) be subscribed in a commodious sense.]</hi> But from hence he hath the skill to extract an Argument to prove that <hi>Grotius</hi> was no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist.</p>
            <p>And is this the Summe of my cruelties and crimes, that I take <hi>Grotius</hi> and those of his mind for Papists? And are they the chief, and almost the only De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders of the Reformed Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Make the Divines of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Belgia,</hi> and <hi>Helvetin,</hi> and other Protestant Countreys be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:170535:169"/> this if you can? Unless it be calculated prophetically for the time, when the <hi>French</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants are destroyed, and the other Protestant Nations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, and the Romane League hath attained its intended end, and none are left in liberty, or suffered to live, but those that <hi>Romanize</hi> as mach as <hi>Grotius;</hi> I can see no more shew of truth in this Assertion, than that the Prelatists are <hi>tantum-non,</hi> the only rational creatures upon earth. But when Mr. <hi>Pierce</hi> hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that <hi>Grotius</hi> owned not <hi>[the new Romish Canons, but only the ancient Canons of the Ʋniversal Church,</hi> and that he was not <hi>for the Popes Supremacy of power,</hi> but only <hi>for his primacy of Order]</hi> (which he affirms, <hi>Discov. pag.</hi> 206, 207.) that is, that <hi>Grotius</hi> was a Liar, or knew not his own mind, who owns the Council of
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:170535:169"/>
               <hi>Trent,</hi> and Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fourths new Creed, and all the Councils and the Mistrisship of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Popes Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Power over the other Churches, (as I have proved in his own express words) then I will confess that I was mistaken in <hi>Grotius,</hi> though I was no ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or persecutor of him, or of the Prelatists. But yet I presume to tell these men, without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to Prophetical Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, That <hi>[HE THAT WILL MAKE DIOCE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SANE PRELACY, OR THE ROMANE PRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MACY, TO BE ES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SENTIAL OR NECES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SARY TO THE ƲNI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ON OR COMMƲNION OF THE ƲNIVERSAL CHƲRCH, SHALL NE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VER HAVE HIS END, BƲT GREATLY SIN</hi>
               <pb n="324" facs="tcp:170535:170"/>
               <hi>AGAINST THE LORD, BY ENCREASING THE DIVISIONS WHICH HE PRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TENDS TO CƲRE.]</hi> The Church will not be United in any means or interest, but such as God hath laid their Unity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Nor are there greater schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks and enemies to its Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than those that will make the self-devised principles of their particular faction, to be Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to the Unity of all the Church.</p>
            <p>I admired when I read Mr. <hi>Pierce,</hi> pag. 213, 214. expostu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating with me, because I will not live in their Communion! I thought I had lived in it. I take it not to be unlawfull to joyn with them in Communion: I never refused it, when I had a Call. I never preacht such Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to others; nor told them
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:170535:170"/> that the Churches were Null that owned Prelacy, or Common-prayer. But did I think they had been so factious themselves, that they would have Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with no Congregations or Ministers about them, that are not of their mind about Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sans or Ceremonies? And that they would take us all as men out of Communion with them, till we come herein to be of their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
            <p>Well <hi>Reader,</hi> thou seest what men we have to deal with, and upon what account I am put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these Apologies. As they differ from us in their other O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, we bear with them, though they will not bear with us: at least, I meddle not with them here. But as they are <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratists,</hi> and keep <hi>Conventicles,</hi> and as <hi>Recusants,</hi> turn their backs upon our Churches, and deny to
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:170535:171"/> hold Communion with us, and tell their followers, that we are no Ministers, and have no true Churches, where there is not Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination by Diocesans; and as they make their Opinions and Government to be matters of Necessity to Christian Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and to the Unity and Peace of the Catholick Church, when they have so hotly declaimed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the like practices in the <hi>Brownists,</hi> and other Separatists before them; thus, and on those accounts it is, that I am here forced to defend the true princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>Catholick Ʋnity</hi> against them; and so must all that will be true to Catholicisme, and to Unity. And how I should justifie the Prelatical <hi>Conventicles</hi> and <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,</hi> while I condemn the like in other Sectaries, I know not, unless I will brand my self with the note of partiality, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:170535:171"/> my own and their reproofs, of that in others which they own. And therefore I must still desire that Justice of all that are for Diocesans, but not for <hi>Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> nor for the nullifying of the Churches and Pastors that in this agree not with them, to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that I speak not a word of this to their dishonour, nor concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them.</p>
            <p>To conclude, I think it well worthy the publick notice of the Nation, what men they be that these <hi>Revilers</hi> mean, when they speak so hatefully of the Puritans as they do. <hi>Philo-Tilenus</hi> tells you they are such as I: And as the Papists to make the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that we are crumbled all into the dust of Schism, do tell them of the <hi>Martinists,</hi> and the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans,</hi> the <hi>Zuinglians,</hi> and the <hi>Oecolampadians,</hi> the <hi>Calvinists,</hi> and the <hi>Bezaites,</hi> &amp;c. so would
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:170535:172"/> this man fain fasten the title of a Sect upon my name, when he chargeth them with no new Opinion, but what the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants that dissented from him, were charged with before. And that you may be sure that <hi>Puritanisme</hi> with them, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what I hold, he makes it my description, as afore-said, that I do <hi>[wholly breathe, the whole of Puritanisme.]</hi> Very good! Will you next consult Mr. <hi>Pierce</hi>'s Discoverer, <hi>pag.</hi> 212, 213. <hi>&amp; passim,</hi> and his former writings for <hi>Grotius</hi> against me: where you shall find that he takes me to be professedly near him in his Doctrinals, (even of <hi>Arminia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism</hi> it self) and to be for Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, and moderate for Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, Holy-dayes, Altars, and such like (for my judgement, take it from my own writings) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon stands wondering that I joyn
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:170535:172"/> not in Communion with them: as if it were <hi>their doctrines,</hi> and <hi>others persons,</hi> that I like best. A Puritan then with some of these men, is one that comes thus near them in Doctrine, Government and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, as Mr. <hi>Pierce</hi> supposeth me to do; or at least as my writings (of Church-Government, Christian Concord, Confirmation, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare me to do. For the odious part of Puritanism of my life, I hear little from them, but my own Confessions (which shall be never the less for their reproaches) and <hi>the possessing of a Sequestration:</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which, if the love of Mr. <hi>Dance</hi> restrained me not, M. <hi>Pierce</hi> might very shortly have an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that would make him blush, if he have any blushing dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on left.</p>
            <p>It is those that know both my Doctrine and Conversation, that I specially commend the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:170535:173"/> to, what <hi>all</hi> that Purita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism is, that these men pour out such scorn and accusations against, <hi>It is all in me:</hi> and therefore no worse than my life and Doctrine tells you of. Such are their unsufferable Round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head Hypocrites. And how would they use us, if we were in their power? I will tell you nothing by collection from their dispositions; but only from their avowed principles. They that take us as unfit for humane socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, would not suffer us in such Societies, if they could help it: They that separate from our Churches, and perswade the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that Ministers and Churches that are without Prelatical Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation are null (though that's not my case) would surely silence such Ministers, and dissolve such Churches through all the Land, if it were in their power; As it
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:170535:173"/> may be, when our sins have ripen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us for so great a plague. I am glad, that as they have decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their desires concerning the usage of the Puritans, so they have satisfied the Nation so farre, what people they mean, and how farre their censures and violence should extend: If to such as me that come so near them, as one that <hi>[Totum Puritanismum to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus spirat]</hi> much more to those that are further from them. But Blessed are the true Peace-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers.</p>
